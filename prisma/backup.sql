Many of us have been praying to a fake god for this moment in history. It’s here. Happy dance. Yay.</p><p>In the old economy, it was all about productivity.</p><ul><li><p>Hustle hard and work long hours</p></li><li><p>Use productivity apps</p></li><li><p>Attend lots of meetings</p></li><li><p>Consume endless amounts of information</p></li></ul><p>What’s changed is AI can now do hard work and meaningless admin at scale. Every day that passes, AI can do more of humans' bullsh*t work.</p><p>Fast forward two more years and humans won’t need to do many of the hard work activities we once did. It’s going to leave a strange void in the world. For once in humanity’s existence we’ll have a lot less to do.</p><p>Before you get excited, it doesn’t mean we’ll all be sitting on mobile recliners watching Netflix all day, as the animated movie Walle-E suggested. No.</p><p>What it means is productivity will no longer f*cking matter.</p><p>What will now matter is creativity.</p><p>Music, art, acting, painting, solving hard problems…. will go back to being the dominant forces that shape the world, the way they did during the Renaissance period hundreds of years ago.</p><p>To prepare for this creative revolution, you’ll need to master the art of unproductivity. Unlike productive habits, the ones that help you be more creative are uns*xy as hell.</p><p>Here are the new habits you’ll need to master.</p><h1>Walk like Socrates through nature as if it’s 350 BC</h1><p>The modern workday sucks because it doesn’t include walking.</p><p>You wake up in a box. Eat from a box. Commute in a box to an office cubicle. And maybe drink a cylinder of Coke for lunch to change things up.</p><p>When I started working for myself one thing that changed is I began to walk like a madman. I’d often turn meetings into walking meetings. I found not only did I feel better, but I was more creative. Walking in nature takes it a step further.</p><p>The greenery and fresh air help the mind unwind.</p><p>Dan Koe once said:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Ancient Romans and Greeks, Steve Jobs, Charles Darwin, and an ever-growing list of visionaries, strategists, and innovators attribute their success to surprisingly low work times accompanied by an abundance of restful activities like long walks.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The greats from the past didn’t work long hours, and going forward we won’t need to either. Walks are a perfect way to fill in the extra time, so when we are working we’re 10x more creative.</p><p>One thing that makes my walks more interesting is imagining that someone from 1000s of years ago walked the same steps that I’m walking right now. It lights a bonfire underneath my imagination and helps me come alive. Try it.</p><p>To unlock your creative superpower make sure to throw your headphones in a lake and walk in silence.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>I’m not saying going for a walk will solve all your problems, I’m just saying there’s no problem that’s going to be made worse by going for a walk – Ryan Holiday</p></div><h1>Daydream in the middle of the day</h1><p>I once sat in the lobby of the bank I worked at daydreaming.</p><p>The next day my boss told me that a “Head of” thought I was slacking off and not talking to enough customers. What that dumbass didn’t realize is, while daydreaming, I thought of a way to onboard more tech companies to our bank using a referral partner.</p><p>This breakthrough would never have happened if I spent 12 hours a day only talking to customers and yelling “buy our bank accounts, sir, they’re the best. We’ll make you rich.”</p><p><strong>New mental model:</strong></p><pre><code>If you learned something at work, it’s probably time to forget it or at least relearn it.</code></pre><p>There’s some sh*tty programming the corporate world infects you with – not being able to daydream is one example.</p><p>Another way to daydream is to go watch traffic on a freeway for 3 hours. The movement of the cars becomes like a free form of meditation. When we daydream we activate our imagination and escape the hell of our to-do list.</p><p>I find spending time with my 1 year old daughter helps too.</p><p>We’re always imagining new games to play, and pretending regular household items are strange characters. The other day my daughter told me the broom was actually a horse that escaped from the enchanted forest. I’ll roll with that. Sounds plausible. The brush does kind of look like a horse’s mane if you think about it.</p><p>What turns an adult back into a baby is a lack of imagination.</p><p>(It’s the new pandem!c, by the way.)</p><p>You’re gonna need that old rusty imagination again if you want to survive the AI wars and still make money in this new economy. Start turning brooms into wild horses.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>The creativity part doesn’t happen without the daydreaming. In my line of work, I need to daydream – Lin-Manuel (creator of the Hamilton Musical)</p></div><h1>Write like Hemingway is your hero</h1><p>I shouldn’t admit this (and don’t tell my wife) but writing makes me h0rny.</p><p>Not in a s*xual way, but in a way where writing forces my brain to come alive and join the dots between ideas.</p><pre><code>I find I have ideas while I write – not the other way around.</code></pre><p>Writing is one of the best ways to be creative. Every artistic outlet can begin with writing.</p><ul><li><p>A movie starts as writing.</p></li><li><p>A painting starts as words on a page.</p></li><li><p>A podcast starts with an email pitch to a guest.</p></li><li><p>A Youtube video starts as a written script (yes, Youtube is mostly all scripted).</p></li></ul><p>Your life will get better if you write every day. The next level is to write and publish on social media. This allows your ideas to become magnets for opportunities and humans that can elevate those ideas beyond your inner world.</p><p>Groups gathering for the purpose of creativity are going to be crucial in the new economy. Let writing help you form the network needed.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking — Leslie Lamport</p></div><h1>Blow your ear drums out with this type of music</h1><p>Modern music sucks.</p><p>I used to be a DJ for 10 years. The rock of the 70s and 80s, or the pop of the 90s, or the house/dance music of the early 2000s is way better than the boring sh*t we have now from artists like Kendrik Lemar.</p><p>They put these stupid filters on their voice that make them sound like robots. I prefer to just listen to a human voice without all the robot sounds.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about music a lot lately.</p><ul><li><p>Is it that we’ve written every chord progression or melody in existence already and that’s why modern music sucks?</p></li><li><p>Is the technology making the music sound worse?</p></li><li><p>Is music not as exciting anymore in a dopamine-fuelled world where you can get bigger rushes of adrenaline from video games or p*rn?</p></li></ul><p>I’ve concluded it’s none of that. Music sucks because creativity is lacking.</p><p>We’re so busy working to cover the high cost of living that there’s not a lot of spare time to be creative.</p><p>Between news, politics, and social media our brains are fried. We’re trained to think the world is worse than it is, so after a while we don’t have the energy or optimism to sit down at a piano and make a beautiful piece of music inspired by a love affair.</p><p>We don’t even have as many love affairs anymore because going to a bar for a drink isn’t as convenient as texting a Tinder buddy (who soon, too, will be an AI bot). Why find love when you can make love to a s*x doll? Sounds odd, but that's where we’re heading.</p><p>The quality of music is a reflection of the quality of human consciousness.</p><p>We’re at rock bottom, especially right before the US election, but thankfully we’re on the cusp of good times and great classic hits again as creativity takes center stage once more.</p><p>To make better music and be more creative we still need music, though. I recommend movie soundtracks. Turn on a bit of Hans Zimmer during the day and watch it change your mood. You’ll feel inspired to create.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>If you listen to songs on your phone sorted by when you added them, you are essentially going back in time. Songs trigger memories, wonderfully so! – Ankur Warikoo</p></div><h1>Read and feel like you’re taking speed</h1><p>The gurus on Twitter/X say reading is procrastination in disguise.</p><p>They say you need to have a goal in mind before you read any book, like everything is a f*cking self-help concert starring Tony Robbins on lead guitar, Jim Rohn on the drums, and Zig Ziglar rapping. Screw those illiterate morons on X.</p><p>Reading is incredible. </p><p>On the surface it’s unproductive. Below the surface it’s the source of better ideas and an expanded vocabulary.</p><p>When your vocabulary expands you get better at explaining things. You become more articulate which makes you a better communicator. In a world of AI, you better hope your human communication skills are first-class.</p><p>The best way to choose a book to read is to follow your curiosity.</p><p>I double dare you to piss off the productivity gurus and read a fiction book. That’ll really get ‘em raging and seeing red! (haha evil Denning)</p><div class="pullquote"><p>To experience time travel, read. To achieve immortality, write – James Clear</p></div><h1>Practice forced solitude while smoking a fat corn cob pipe</h1><p>Loners are the new elites.</p><p>Being unproductive often means being alone. The need to be around others all the time is often why people work office jobs. They can’t stand not to have office friends. I don’t say this as an insult. Nope.</p><p>I worked in banking for 10 years longer than I should because I was lonely.</p><p>Seeing Greg the concierge or Amelia the cleaner was the highlight of my day. We’d talk smack about lots of stuff, even topics I had no clue about (like AFL football).</p><p>Disappearing to a wood cabin in a forest and smoking a corn cob pipe used to be the dream. Then people laughed at it. In this creative boom, it’s going to become the goal again.</p><p>Suburban life has downsides. Where I live it’s a chorus of dogs barking 24/7. I may be home alone as I write this, but it feels like I’ve got 101 Dalmatians sitting next to me.</p><p>Without true solitude it’s hard to think deeply. It’s hard to uncover those big ideas we have stuck inside our s*xy brains. Start escaping to the woods now as a habit, so you can develop this skill in time for the creative boom.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>It takes 4-6 weeks of uncomfortable isolation to create a new vision for yourself, and your life – Zach Pogrob</p></div><h1>Be quieter than normal</h1><p>The productivity age loves talking.</p><p>Go into a productive workplace and you’ll see endless meetings full of people talking over the top of each other. People just keep talking because they want to feel like they’re #AddingValue or coming across as smart to their colleagues.</p><p>True creative people are quieter than two ants having s*x.</p><p>Record producer Rick Rubin is one such example. The dude has a long beard and is famous for being quiet in front of the world’s biggest musicians. Or take actor Keanu Reeves (who I’m convinced is Jesus reincarnated).</p><p>The guy does these big-ass interviews and spends much of the time taking long pauses and looking up at the ceiling. I’ve found quiet people have smaller egos. This makes them more creative because our ego often stands in the way of our best ideas.</p><p>Listen more than you talk. Try saying nothing for the next 24 hours.</p><blockquote><p>Quiet people have the loudest minds – Stephen Hawking</p></blockquote><h1>Final Thought</h1><p>The mind is your biggest asset. Without taking care of it, you’ll never be creative enough to thrive in the digital renaissance of the 2020s.</p><p>Get used to feeling like you’re pissing your time down the toilet. Being unproductive is how you’ll increase your creativity, so you can outperform AI and carve a path in life that’ll lead you to personal freedom.</p><p>Tell me which of these unproductive ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S. Are you writing online?&nbsp;</p><p>If so, how's it going?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://forms.gle/52b4ZFkQCDLXdfQF7">Take my gut-check survey here.</a></p></body></html>	Productivity cult fades as AI takes over mundane tasks. Creativity becomes key. Embrace unproductivity: walk in nature, daydream, write daily, listen to inspiring music, read widely, seek solitude, and practice quietness.	2024-09-26 11:04:39	2024-10-05 19:39:39.567	2024-10-10 14:04:45.042	{english}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26f73617-4fc7-4d55-94ac-9ec4b01edd92_999x869.jpeg	Tim Denning	you-must-master-the-art-of-unproductivity-if-you-want-to-be-successful-in-the-new-economy

Their big Lambo exhaust pipes, massive rubber wheels, gold chains, Rolex, and cheeky grins. There’s a photo of me somewhere on the internet bent over the front of a Lambo as if it’s mine.</p><p>The dream was to start an IT company. That’s what every dude did in the early 2000s to get rich. Or invent a phone app. Now in a world of AI we can generate these digital assets for a few dollars.</p><p>I’ve learned what’s better than being a millionaire, though, is having F*ck You (F U) money. It’s a life-changing concept that’ll change how you work, live, and earn/spend money.</p><h1>People want this more than money</h1><p>The path to big cash seems smart.</p><p>You go from being a postcode povo to working your butt off and eventually making enough cash to live large in a mansion.</p><p>Except this isn’t the dream.</p><p>I’ve achieved the goal of F U money and so have many of my closest friends. People don’t really want loads of money, even though at the start they genuinely feel they do.</p><p>What they secretly want below the surface is free time.</p><p>This is a paradox though. The way to get more free time is to buy it with money. So unless you figure out how to make more money and increase your leverage, you’ll always be dreaming of little Cinderella fairies with $100 bills while sniffing the invisible coke of an unreachable dream.</p><p>So… how you think about money is crucial to unlocking F U money.</p><h1>F U money is about having zero luxury possessions</h1><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Yep. Buying luxury seems stupid when you have the ultimate prize of unlimited free time. I met a woman yesterday. She works at Apple. She lives in Melbourne near me but in a nicer postcode.</p><p>She was telling me how she bought this awesome BMW, and how they just went on a family trip in it. It was so comfortable and nice to drive, she said.</p><blockquote><p>Me: “That BMW must have cost a lot.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Her: “Well, not really. It’s on a novated lease, so I pay $3000 a month for it.”</p></blockquote><p>She then asked me what car I drive. I told her about my Honda Civic that turned 9 years old a few days ago. She didn’t get it.</p><blockquote><p>“Why the heck would you drive that piece of crap when you don’t need to?”</p></blockquote><p>She didn’t understand F U money, which is fine. Not here to judge anyone. We don’t know what we don’t know. There’s no MBA in F U money (maybe I’ll create it).</p><p>We dug a little deeper. She told me how she used to have a great boss at Apple. Then they quit and now the new boss is an ass. He made her last two bonuses go to zero.</p><p>She still has her high salary, but in Australia she knows not too many other employers will pay her that much.</p><p>At 50 years old she’s terrified of layoffs or being fired by the new boss. Then we circle back to me. Why do I drive the Honda Civic? Because when I had the high salary I didn’t waste money on bullsh*t luxuries that took me further away from F U money.</p><p>I was happy to drive the Civic and look poor so that now I can be wealthy and free. The trouble is once I got F U money, I couldn’t talk myself out of driving a crap car or living in an average house.</p><ul><li><p>Needing luxury is a band-aid people buy when they’re not free.</p></li><li><p>Luxury is stupid to people who have F U money.</p></li></ul><p>F U money is a mindset. It’s not just getting more money, it’s not needing so much money.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can't fathom” – Naval Ravikant</p></div><h1>You no longer care about titles or status</h1><p>In startup wank land people get h0rny over self-appointed titles they give themselves like founder or entrepreneur.</p><p>In corporate wank land it’s all about the “Head of Nothing” or “Chief Pleb Officer” titles. I used to froth over these.</p><p>Getting an email from a Chief felt like losing my virginity. The feeling would wear off in seconds and I’d be right back to boredom and uncreative work. I later became a title titty, in love with sucking up to whoever the new, big job title was on the block.</p><p>Things have changed.</p><p>According to the title titties I’m currently a founder, CEO, or entrepreneur. But I don’t use any of these labels. My email signature is blank. I sign off with the word “Tim.” I have no real company logo. I just don’t f*cking care about titles anymore.</p><p>You could be The President Of The United States and I still don’t care.</p><p>Nobody tells me what to do, and I can leave my computer at any time and piss the day away eating banana sundaes if I want. Can ya do that at Amazon, bro? Nope. That’s what F U money does. It makes you immune to titles and status.</p><p>Here’s the simple path to F U money:</p><h1>1. People need to know who the f*ck you are and what you stand for</h1><p>Ghosts don’t get sh*t.</p><p>A ghost is the typical human. They have a resume which is full of a bunch of nice stuff they say about themselves. They then bribe a bunch of people they barely know who they worked with to be references and back up the lies on their resume.</p><p>If you google them nothing comes up. They say stupid phrases like “trust me” when you ask about their capability.</p><p>They can tell you about a lot of stuff they’ve done, but what they don’t tell you is these achievements were divided unevenly across 50 different people. So trying to find out what they really did is impossible.</p><p>There’s a level above this. They’re the personal brand romantics. They are great at holding selfie poles in front of their big noses and reciting Mark Twain quotes until they get drunk from all the likes and go flog themselves off in a corner.</p><p>The path to F U money is simpler. You don’t need any of that.</p><p>What you need is a riot act. A go-to-war mission statement that builds a movement. Some sort of online presence that isn’t all about you and your finger bang g-string line that launched last Friday at 3 AM for a limited time only.</p><p>The gurus will tell you to get 1M followers. I’d suggest you target 5000-10,000 followers and convert them into a newsletter faster than Usain Bolt.</p><p>Remember: if I don’t know you and you have no social proof, then I don’t trust you and I sure as hell aren’t giving you an opportunity that helps you reach the milestone of F U money.</p><p>Takeaway: build a small movement using social media.</p><h1>2. Upgrade from business virgin to at least this level</h1><p>Few weeks ago a person committed fraud against me.</p><p>They said they’ve worked in sales for 30 years working for this iconic Silicon Valley tech company. Part of the reason they got pissed off at me is they claimed I “upsold them” via email.</p><p>According to his 30 years in sales, upselling is unethical. People only buy one product then never want anything ever again, even though he fan-girls over Microsoft Office which upsells people on the daily (because Microsoft Word can’t fix every problem a person encounters in their life/business).</p><p>Obviously I disagreed with him (side note: they were later found guilty of fraud).</p><p>I call people like this business virgins.</p><p>Someone else’s logo did the selling for him. John, you were an order taker, mofo. There’s little to no skill involved when the sales and marketing are done for you. You’re just the whip cream on top of the sundae. People are buying whether you’re there or not. Wait until all that is gone. Then we’ll see what you’re made of, chief.</p><p>When you become an owner your understanding of business and the financial markets is massively upgraded. You go from a 5th grader understanding of business and money to a billionaire on a yachts understanding of money.</p><p>Not because you’re smarter, but because being an owner forces you to take off the adult-size nappy and sh*t yourself every day for a few years.</p><p>If you’re not an owner you’ll never have F U money.</p><p>A job is modern slavery. Start there but don’t end there, amigo.</p><h1>3. Invest like the best (not what you think)</h1><p>F U money sounds like a sales pitch for “buy real estate” or “invest in the S&amp;P 500 and you’ll be a rich b*tch at 95 when you can’t piss by yourself anymore.”</p><p>But the finance bros are wrong.</p><p>The best investment you can ever make is in yourself. What you don’t know is stopping you from the things that’ll make you enough money to permanently forget about money.</p><div class="pullquote"><pre><code><em>"It costs less to learn how to make $100,000 per year than it does to not know how to make $100,000 per year." </em>– Alex Hormozi</code></pre></div><p>In the last 30 days I’ve spent $30,000+ on education – courses, masterminds, 1-1 coaching, group coaching, etc.</p><p>I never used to do this. I was a tight-arse. But that’s why I couldn’t figure out the online game. I’m a 7-figure creator. If I want to become an 8-figure creator, I need to learn from and spend time with 8-figure creators.</p><p>An 8-figure creator isn’t gonna let me “pick their brain” over a raspberry milkshake because I’ve got gorgeous dimples and a 1/4 of a 6-pack. So I’ve learned to spend money to get around the people and ideas that’ll take me to the next level.</p><p>A few weeks in a mastermind can make me more money than 40 years investing in the S&amp;P 500 can. Ohh… and self-education for owners is usually tax deductible. As a result, I now have an unlimited self-education budget.</p><p>(There’s one caveat with this approach which is it assumes you learn from people with social-proof who are practitioners. Obviously, if you invest in stupid sh*t sold by grifters and wannabes who teach people to make $50 per article on Medium dot com, well, you’re heading straight for the welfare line.)</p><p>Once your self-education is taken care of the next step is to reinvest in the business that is you. Maybe you’re a solopreneur or an entrepreneur with a few employees by this point. Nice one.</p><p>Instead of taking money out of a business it’s better to reinvest in your business. </p><p>Because, once again, a business will make more money than copying Grandpa Warren Buffet’s investing strategy from last century.</p><p>The last stage of the funnel is investing in financial assets - stocks, gold, crypto, real estate, etc. This is the cherry on top and requires a basic financial education.</p><p>The point of financial assets, that most people don’t get, is they’re a way for you to store your wealth and protect against that wealth being stolen in the form of inflation. Said another way, financial assets store your time and prevent leaks.</p><p>Takeaway: income is always #1 priority, storage of wealth is #2.</p><h1>4. Blow up your brain &amp; go mildly insane</h1><ul><li><p>No more consumerism – discounts, specials, coupons.</p></li><li><p>No more politics/news – Fox, elections, CNN, Donald Duck.</p></li><li><p>No more losers – toxic people, complainers, blamers, people who always feel oppressed or worship the idea they’re a minority.</p></li><li><p>No more imposter syndrome – social proof wipes out the “I’m not an expert or “I’m not qualified.” These feelings are implanted deep in our brains from years ago, so we’ll justify paying $100K for a degree and maybe being silly enough to buy another one as a mature adult.</p></li></ul><p>Bottom line: No more fear.</p><p>Your brain helps navigate you towards F U money. If it’s messed up and distracted by all the stuff in the world you alone can't solve, it ain’t gonna help. Nothing is gonna happen. You’ll do what most people do and stand still screaming “I’m busy!”</p><p>Society needs us to feel busy so we’ll forget our freedom dream that leads to F U money. If you find yourself saying <em>I’m busy,</em> you’re already not free.</p><p>The solution is to prioritize freedom by pursuing this simple path to F U money. You now have the core steps. Go do it. Get free.</p><p>Tell me whether you agree with the idea of F U money and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

He told me to add “employable skills,” get plenty of certificates for different stuff like an MBA, and always build my career network.</p><p>Staying employable became a mantra that motivated me. I always felt if I lost my focus on being employable, my career would end, and I’d plunge into darkness and poverty.</p><p>A few weeks ago I got a punch in the guts. A former banker I used to work with said:</p><blockquote><pre><code>“Tim, there’s no nice way to say this but you’re now unemployable. You can never go back to banking. You’ve crossed to the other side. What if your online thing doesn’t work?”</code></pre></blockquote><p>I realized in that moment they were right. I will never be employed again.</p><h1>What it bizarrely means to be unemployable (see if you can relate)</h1><p>To understand the reality of being unemployable, we first need to look at the other side of the spectrum.</p><p>Writer Sean Cheo explains the current business environment better than I can:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Corporate hiring is broken.</em></p><p><em>AI-drafted job specs with unrealistic expectations, ATS (Application Tracking System) filters, 6+ rounds of interviews, 25 hour ‘practical tests’, rampant ghosting... all for a chance to get a low-ball offer then laid off within a year because the CEO wants another 8% annual pay bump.</em></p><p><em>I find it absolutely insane that right now it's easier to make money off crypto, the stock market and self-employment in that order than it is to land a full-time job.</em></p><p><em>And this seems to be consistent across age groups. The young get rejected for lack of experience, the old for ageism, all while the same vacancy gets refreshed every few weeks.</em>”</p></blockquote><p>Being employable <em><strong>used</strong></em> to be the American Dream.</p><p>Now it’s the American nightmare. I’d rather go to hell than join the current circus that is corporate and the business world. It’s a joke.</p><p>Last week I stopped working with a long-term client. They told me they’re now too busy to work with me. I went back through the notes. When we first met he was working 9-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.</p><p>Now he’s working 16-hour days and all weekend. So he’s right, he is too busy. What he can’t see is the transition into this death spiral. Last year he was a froggy sitting in warm water. This year he’s a froggy sitting in almost boiling water.</p><p>I said this: “How far can this go?”</p><p>It’s 16 hours a day now. Does he break at 18 hours a day? 19 hours? To top it off, he told me he has two kids.

Solopreneurship, contracting, freelancing, consulting, and coaching are exploding like never before. In my last 9-5 job ever, at a bank, about 50% of the 40,000 people they employed were what they call flexi-workers (I was a consultant employed by a consulting firm.)</p><p>The trend of full-time employees is slowly dying. Why…</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Once you taste the money of working for yourself you automatically become unemployable” – Wyld Tribe</p></div><p>It’s not just the money either. It’s the freedom.</p><p>Screw commuting hours every day to sit on a chair in front of a computer when you could do the same from home. It used to make sense pre-2020. Now it just seems crazy to a rational person.</p><p>With the right skills you can serve multiple employers at a time.</p><p>In my last consulting gig, I consulted to several banks simultaneously. What I did for one bank I could do for another. Business isn’t that complicated. You can copy and paste your skills to any corporation. You can serve an Aussie client today, and an Indian one tomorrow.</p><p>Expect the trend of solo business owners to continue.</p><h1>Here’s how to become unemployable so you can experience personal freedom</h1><p>A few ideas to get your mind cranking and your heart pumping.</p><h3>1. Believe in ownership</h3><p>As an employee you’re a renter with a landlord.</p><p>At any moment you can be evicted thanks to the magic of layoff culture. To become unemployable like me you must understand ownership and the benefits. The biggest takeaway of ownership for me is how tax works.</p><ul><li><p>As an employee your tax is taken out before you get paid.</p></li><li><p>As an owner you get paid in full then decide when, how much, and how you want to pay tax.</p></li></ul><p>This gap in the matrix has doubled, if not tripled, my personal net worth (legally).</p><p>If you like being told what to do and having zero ownership, stay employable. But without ownership you’ll never be wealthy and you’ll always be told what to do.</p><h3>2. Reject corporate nonsense</h3><p>Politics is a hell hole.</p><p>The 2024 U.S. election is painful to endure. It took me a decade to realize working for a corporation is no different. The workplace is full of politics by default. There is no promotion or career ascension without playing politics.</p><p>That means you have to act fake, mislead people, and play each other off as if you’re a character in the movie Hunger Games.</p><p>Only once I left corporate did I realize how stupid it was.</p><p>Sitting in back-to-back meetings. Wearing a penguin suit every day. Saying the right thing. Pretending to care about a war in Europe. Wearing a badge on my suit jacket for whatever random special day of the year it was.</p><p>When I visit my 1 year old daughter’s daycare, honestly, it reminds me of the workplace. In fact her daycare is more civilized than any workplace I’ve seen. A workplace has lunch breaks, lockers for bags, a desk to sit at, teachers to tell you what to do, and story time aka town halls.</p><p>I don’t want to work in an adult daycare ever again. Perhaps you can relate.</p><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> until you hate corporate culture you won’t leave. Get real about it. Do you really love it?</p><h3>3. Become unreasonable enough to think you must be paid more</h3><p>If you think you’re paid fairly you’ll never leave.</p><p>I used to think $700 a week with $100 leftover at the end was great. Then I got one client outside of my bank job that paid me $200 for a 1-hour video call. It bent my reality. In the open market online you can get paid a lot more.</p><p>The point of a corporation is to make a profit. That means they need to pay employees the least amount possible to maximize their profits. So the incentives of a job literally work against your personal goals. Yet 99% don’t realize.</p><p>Your income could probably double if not triple what it is now. That’s a huge knife to the chest for some.</p><p>Don’t quit a job. Experiment outside of your job to prove it to yourself (then send me a commission of $1000 and let’s call it even…joking not joking).</p><h3>4. Make money online and don't be a skeptical pleb</h3><p>Skeptical people don’t make it in life.</p><p>They also can’t become unemployable. There’s a level of optimism and open-mindedness needed to transition away from being employable.</p><p>Almost 5 years ago I partnered with a stranger named Todd. We did an experiment together. It worked. So we did another one. Then we became business partners.</p><p>I live in Australia. He lives in Tennessee. He has all my passwords. I know the code to his cupboard full of naughty books from an adult shop (Jane Austen novels).</p><p>Todd and I have never met. Read that again.</p><p>Maybe he’s 4-foot or a drug dealer or smokes meth. No clue. Don’t care. I didn’t trust him. Nope, I validated through proof of work.</p><p>If I was a skeptical pleb that outcome would never have happened. It requires some level of trust. Contrast that with a reader I met last week who was petrified to put their credit card number into a website for a $50 newsletter purchase.</p><p>The internet isn’t a scam. Neither is AI or crypto.</p><p>These systems run the Earth, and you either understand and take advantage of them, or get replaced by them.</p><p>The way to defeat skepticism is to try some stuff. Take some small, calculated risks. Cap your downside so that if one risk, a $50 newsletter, blows up in your face, you don’t go bankrupt and end up living in a gutter eating beans and rice.</p><p>Have you ever felt unemployable?

The worst humans on the planet are people who’ve never failed. They lie to us. They pretend to have a go. But they never do.</p><p>They refuse to fail which is a hate crime against humanity. If we don’t fail, humanity doesn’t progress. That’s a sin. It makes you a disgrace. My bizarre hack for figuring out if I can trust someone is to find out if they’ve ever failed.</p><p>Here’s a radically different way to think about failure so you can make your big goals a reality.</p><h1>The most dangerous person you’ll ever meet</h1><p>A few months back, a person committed fraud against me.</p><p>They paid for a coaching service that I delivered. The coaching call was recorded, and at the end, they kept saying how much the coaching helped. I left the meeting with a big smile. This is my legacy. This is why I quit my banking career forever.</p><p>A few weeks later, I got a notification saying this customer was accusing me of never delivering the service. I contacted them and went back and forth via email.</p><p>I was shocked to learn they were willing to lie and commit fraud against me, so they could avoid ever starting their business. Their problem wasn’t me, it was failure.</p><p>That’s right, they were willing to commit a crime to avoid the chance of failure.</p><p>I met another person through writing online who was similar. They’d got themselves into a sticky situation. Because of a divorce and a loss of job, they’d likely lose everything. To avoid the failure they took their own life. It broke my heart.</p><p>People who aren’t willing to fail will do crazy, murderous acts.</p><h1>It all starts with a tiny error in thinking</h1><p>We don’t come out of our mommy’s womb being failure-resistant. It’s a learned skill.</p><p>Avoidance of failure starts with not taking any risks. You won’t invest money in yourself. You won’t buy a $100 course. You won’t invest in financial assets like stocks.

Now you’re free bird…fly high as a kite.</p><h1>The best part of failure is easily overlooked</h1><p>Stories are the driving force of humanity.</p><p>We all know that. Stories are what create famous people and produce movies that win Oscars. The common part of all good stories is failure.

That’s the truth.</p><p>The failures make you magnetic. They make you human. They make you trustworthy. They make you seem worth knowing.</p><pre><code>Failures help you generate your own wisdom.</code></pre><p>When you don’t fail you learn jack sh*t. You stay stuck in overthinking, procrastination, ma$trubation, and perfectionism. The road to hell is paved with a lack of failure.</p><p>Ever met a know-it-all? They’re the ones that don’t fail. And they throw peanuts at people like me who have failed.</p><p>“See, look at what Denning did wrong.

Nope. It’s the failure virgins.</p><h1>“We shouldn’t glorify failure p*rn” – critics</h1><p>Yes we should.</p><p>You should want to fail. You should expect to fail. Most things you try in life won’t work the first time. That’s the whole point. Trying one time is a disaster. You try the same thing multiple times and iterate slightly each time. That’s how you figure out what does work.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“It is a curse to have everything go right on your first attempt” – Robert Greene</p></div><p>I treat life like a series of science experiments, even though I failed the subject (thanks to Professor Tweddle D*ck in high school).</p><p>No one knows what works.</p><p>Guessing doesn’t work.

And waiting to be chosen by gatekeepers definitely doesn’t work.</p><p>The only way to figure stuff the hell out is to 100% expect to fail.</p><p>Yet this goes counter to conventional wisdom. 99% of people aren’t willing to fail. They’re proactively trying to avoid failure at all costs. That’s why average people like me can succeed because there’s little to no competition.</p><p>What a time to be alive. Soak it up. Enjoy the view. Risk failing in all your glory because nobody gives a sh*t if you do.</p><h1>The question from Tony Robbins that changed my life forever</h1><p>Tony the tall mofo (god bless him) shook my world up when he challenged a group of us to answer this question:</p><p>What’s the worst that can happen?</p><p>The challenge is to get scary with it. Imagine your worst nightmare. Get creative. Picture all the doomsday scenarios. Imagine Orange Man Trump gets elected and a nuclear bomb goes off all in the same day. Times it by ten. Do a strip dance in Times Square. Stab yourself a few times with a steak knife to add some bloody effects.</p><p>Now…. what’s the worst that happens?</p><p>Not much.</p><p>You wake up the next day and try again, except this time you have some failures to tell you what NOT to do.</p><p>When I lost $1.2M in a day it felt like I was being cremated alive in a funeral parlour in front of my unborn daughter.</p><p>The money was gone but the way I made it wasn’t. I knew how to do it again. So I did. This time I made the money back 10x faster because I had the shortcuts already.</p><p>Whatever the nightmare scenario is, it’s a lie. Comebacks are always possible. They’re the default. And from the place of rock bottom you have the free motivation and drive to go faster than everyone else.</p><p>This is gonna sound whack, but I hope you fail with whatever goal you’re working on right now. I really want you to get this gift from heaven.</p><h1>Closing Thought</h1><p>Never trust people who refuse to fail.</p><p>If you’re currently someone who’s immune to failure, it’s time to stop being a criminal and change. There’s no way to get what you want without failure.</p><p>The myth of overnight success lied to you. America’s Got Talent isn’t going to give you a golden buzzer and make all your dreams come true (just look at the 99.99999999% of talent that never made it on any TV talent show).</p><p>The good news is you’re only one failure away from figuring out what does work, so you can finally live a life of freedom most will never be able to imagine.

It’s unrealistic to go from a regular salary to $0 and build some business, movement, or not-for-profit based on hope.</p><p>The way I built my own thing was using the first 2 hours of the day in a different way to most people. Change how you use the first 2 hours of the day, transform your life.</p><h1>Building out of desperation leads to disaster</h1><p>When I say build your own thing, I’m talking about building something online.</p><p>A social media audience, online business, movement, paid community, newsletter, blog, network, etc – the options are endless.</p><p>To master this goal you first need to ensure you don’t make the #1 mistake: building out of desperation. A guy I met, James, illustrates this perfectly. He wanted to build an empire online around mindfulness.</p><blockquote><p>“I have $1000 left to my name &amp; need to have this make money in the next 30 days.”</p></blockquote><p>As a result he was looking for shortcuts, tricks, and to buy followers. He even considered spamming people with his mindfulness course. The week after I met him he was putting links to his programs all over other writers’ Substack post comments.</p><p>This is what desperation does. It makes you weak. It makes you look cheap. And that’ll repel people the way bug spray murders spiders.</p><p>What works better is to make sure you have your main income locked down first, then you build your online empire.</p><h1>The day is won or lost in the morning</h1><p>It’s common to leave building your own thing until the end of the day. This is when your energy is the lowest and you’re least disciplined.</p><p>The temptation to trade the 2 hours you have to build your freedom machine for some Netflix or drinks with friends is too high, even for a David Goggins navy seal-type.</p><p>What’s worse is those who plan to build their own thing on weekends or holidays. And the ultimate failure is to build your own thing when you’re retired (may as well set the dream on fire right now).</p><p>What you can control is today.</p><p>The first 2 hours of every day are an opportunity most will piss all over. I famously remember one guy my friend Ayo spoke to who said they had no time to build anything. They handed over their daily schedule. It included an hour for eating breakfast and 2 hours of housework in the morning.</p><pre><code>If you bullsh*t yourself, no one can help you.</code></pre><p>We can find 2 hours to build if we understand how important it is. The way I do that is to consider the alternative…</p><h1>Defy what the system told you</h1><p>Parents, university, bosses, employers, friends and/or cultural norms in your country likely all told you to follow a predictable path.</p><p>These predictable paths create the societal system that enslaves most people without them realizing it.</p><p>My friend Niha is a woman from India. She quit her consulting career to work 3 hours a day as an online writer. Her family thinks she’s nuts. Her former colleagues barely speak to her. Not even her husband gets it.</p><p>She said to me:</p><blockquote><p>“Women aren’t this bold in my culture. They have a place. They go to university, get a job their parents approve of, then get married to someone who’s chosen for them and start popping out kids.”</p></blockquote><p>She wanted more out of life so she said no.</p><p>If you don’t build for the first 2 hours, what you have is the nightmare of the predictable path that a lot of people are trying to escape and don’t know how.</p><p>You don’t escape prison in a moment’s notice. Watch the TV show Prison Break. You build an escape plan then slowly test it until you make your calculated escape.</p><p>The way we deal with the downsides of a conventional life society wants to have is to eat sugar, drink alcohol, drown in distractions, and to endlessly entertain ourselves to death with Netflix and superhero movies.</p><p>There’s a better way of life.</p><h1>Go all in like a mofo</h1><p>Ideas are like a**holes, everyone has them.</p><p>The only way this first 2 hours of every day plan works is if you commit. Scrap that. It only works if you go all in like a mofo.</p><p>Lukewarm plans are easy to override. Full-on commitment is harder to back out of, especially if you tell others who will hold you accountable.</p><p>I always built my own thing while working a job. It’s only when the 2020 layoffs were in full swing that I ramped up my efforts. I went from working on my thing when I could to blocking off whole mornings.</p><p>I had no expectations. The mornings I did it were lonely. Complete solitude. It was just me and the sound of birds outside my apartment window.</p><p><strong>It’s hard to describe it.</strong> They were some of the best days of my life. Some of my clearest writing came out of me.</p><p>People close to me knew I wasn’t f*cking around. In a way, it made them quietly proud of me. They saw I was growing from a child living in an adult’s body into a man who lived up to his values and couldn’t be controlled by anyone or anything.</p><p>The 2 hours a day were hard to get in.</p><p>My work email was always overflowing. I got so ruthless toward the end of this journey that I started to show up for my day job later and later. It used to be 8 AM, then 9, then 10, then right at the end I was clocking in at 11 AM.</p><p>Checking out of a job so I could check into my real goal felt incredible.</p><h1>It starts with releasing your ideas</h1><p>Ideas stay trapped in our heads.</p><p>The pressure to release those ideas builds up like a toilet with a turd clogging it up. To get some relief, we start to get fantasies of writing a book.</p><p>We tell ourselves we’ll put our ideas in there. We may take some notes over time. We may even write some chapters of the book.</p><p><em>But the book never comes out.</em></p><p>Finally, we retire at 65 and write the book. Then we publish it on Amazon and nobody reads it. Now we think our ideas weren’t that good and it ends in what I call last-leg-of-life depression. Feelings we could have been more, as well as deep regrets.</p><p>We continue to grow old, then join the long queue for the cemetery and wait our turn. All that potential then turns to dirt and the worms munch on your remains.</p><p>The simple solution isn’t to let ideas clog up our minds.</p><p>Part of building your own thing is to release your ideas into the online world through social media.</p><ul><li><p>These ideas become the foundation for whatever you want to build.</p></li><li><p>They also help you attract the people who can help you build, and for whom you’re building something for.</p></li></ul><p>This daily release of ideas stops fantasies of writing books from destroying your life.</p><h1>Listen to your curiosity. Pay attention to your true desires.</h1><p>Humans are great at settling.</p><p>We hide our true desires and convince ourselves an office job or by-the-hour manual labor work is our calling. It’s not. To build something of your own you have to dare to follow your curiosity.</p><p>My 1 year old daughter is growing up fast. I can’t wait to tell her that her dad is Alice from the book “Alice In Wonderland.” I spend entire days falling down rabbit holes and not coming up for air. I let my curiosity go absolutely wild.</p><p>It’s fun as hell.</p><p>Some days that leads me to become the mad hatter from the story, too. But inside madness and chaos is our ability to transcend ourselves. Our curiosity is the map to our true desires that we so eloquently bury and let die when we become adults.</p><p>Curiosity is the path back to happiness.</p><h1>How to win the first 2 hours of every day</h1><p>Let’s get practical.</p><h3>1. Wake up earlier</h3><p>If you have a job or kids, then some parts of the day aren’t flexible. I had the same problem. The only solution is to wake up earlier.</p><p>It sounds crazy the first time you think of it. But if you can wake up earlier for a week you’ll realize it’s 100% possible. You either find the time or let excuses like “I have kids dontcha know” hold you back.</p><p>I don’t give a sh*t if you think your life is special. It’s not. Make it happen or watch others make it happen. Own or be owned. Choice is yours.</p><h3>2. Try removing the warm-up routine</h3><p>The song and dance with morning routines is ridiculous.</p><p>One way to build in the first 2 hours of the day is to remove the warm-up. No morning routine. No “I’ll start after my coffee.” No “I’ll read my emails first.” Nope. Just do the hardest step and start. Get straight into it and watch how fast you get momentum.</p><h3>3. Start the night before</h3><p>Every night I used to write down what I wanted to do in my 2 hours of power the following morning. I still do this today.</p><p>Looking at a blank screen is a nightmare. We have things we want to build and there are steps to take to make it happen. Some pre-planning works wonders so you can just wake up and start.</p><p>Start your morning the night before.</p><h3>4. Leave this devil device out of sight</h3><p>The devil doesn’t wear Prada. The devil is your phone.</p><p>This distraction machine will guarantee you don’t have 2 hours in the morning. Easy solution is to leave your phone out of sight. No Whatsapp/Telegram. No emails. No phone calls or checking the weather or seeing what meetings you have.</p><p>That last one is key. When I used to be foolish enough to sometimes look at what meetings I had for the day first thing, the anxiety would start to build. I’d get so anxious I couldn’t build anything in the first 2 hours of the day.</p><p>It was 10x worse for me because I used to suffer from anxiety. It used to make my hands shake all day, give me runny poos, and exclude me from social events. It ultimately ended in the collapse of my successful eCommerce business.</p><p>The best work is done in a calm, relaxed state. Remove the phone and anxiety from the early morning, and you’ll build better.</p><h3>5. Giggle like Pamela Anderson and have fun</h3><p>The joker in Batman was right: “Why so serious?”</p><p>That’s why I hate modern adult life and working for corporations. It’s all too serious. The point of building your own thing for 2 hours every day is to come alive and have fun. It’s to experience the pure joy of creation. It’s to make up your own rules.</p><p>Make sure what you’re building is fun.</p><h1>Closing Thought</h1><p>The good life starts with one small step.</p><p>Building your own thing for the first 2 hours of every day is the best logical step you can take right now. I freaking dare you to give it a go and see what happens.</p><p>Tell me what you want to build (or are building) and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S.

They “#tried” instead of obsess like a maniac and make it happen by being high agency.</p><p>Passion is disgusting, it’s criminal.</p><p>Writer Zach Pogrob has a going-to-war <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-vgdXwJZec/">mantra</a> he suggests people who want to be successful should follow. I’m going to dissect every detail for you.</p><h1>Daily routines need war</h1><p>What’s misunderstood about true success is it sits on the knife’s edge of calmness, focus, present-moment awareness … and chaos, fury, anger, frustration, and rejection.</p><p>I’ve chased this path for 10 years and it’s nearly broken me multiple times. But in those moments my mindset shifted and I became someone new.</p><p>The world is never at peace.</p><p>We’re always on the edge of nuclear war. Some small war in Europe or the Middle East could easily blow up into World War 3. We need this chaos to have the relatively peaceful times we’ve seen in the world since World War 2.</p><pre><code>Nature doesn’t function in calmness.</code></pre><p>We need the snakes to kill the rats and bite the humans. We need the floods to clear the land and drown people to make room for new life.</p><p>Wanting life to be calm is a fatal human error.</p><p>Every day you’re meant to fight a war of some kind. If you’re not you’re leaving your potential on the table. You’re drowning in piss-weak self-care and work-life balance that will slowly poison your dreams and goals.</p><p>If your habits are cookie-cutter and without chaos, you’re probably on the path to mediocrity, sorry to say.</p><p>Add war.</p><h1>Schedule discomfort</h1><p>If your life feels good you’re probably one step away from rock bottom. Or complete and utter meaningless that’ll bore you to tears. Success and discomfort go together like a Big Mac and fries.</p><p>Wake up early. Like, I dare you to wake up at 4 AM and witness the beauty. I dare you to go to the gym at 7 AM on a Saturday like I did last week. It’s in these moments you realize there’s zero competition.</p><p>People hate discomfort. Their loss is your opportunity.</p><p>You don’t need to be better. No. Just different.</p><p><em>Different</em> could be embracing discomfort. Or doing an intense workout every day for a year. Or spending more time on your goals than feels healthy or #normal. Or missing every social function for the next 90 days. Or daring to email Netflix and cancel your subscription – and Amazon, Disney, and whatever other entertainment.</p><p>Going without entertainment is uncomfortable. Eating beans and rice with a drink of water feels uncomfortable, too. After a while the discomfort becomes normal. Pain turns into pleasure. That pleasure becomes obsession and drives you to insane results.</p><blockquote><p>Fall in love with “enjoyable torture,” says Zach Pogrob.</p></blockquote><h1>“Chaos gives you clarity, in a way peace never could”</h1><p>Zach nails it with this line.</p><p>When I was at peace in a banking job back in 2021, I found I didn’t have a lot of good ideas. I was sleepwalking through life like a zombie. I had no real reason to grow or change. Life’s incentives were stacked against me.</p><p>The worst that could happen was I’d get laid off. But that came with a 6-figure payout and 90 days before I’d be out the door.</p><p>So the motivation to evolve was still zero.</p><p>When I left and started my own business I witnessed terrifying chaos. No day is the same. There’s no guaranteed income. One day I could get hacked. The next day I could be banned from LinkedIn. And the day after that I could get a surprise tax bill for $200K and not be able to pay (all of this happened).</p><p>With the wrong mindset I initially thought these situations were curses. Now I see them as opportunities.</p><p>2021 Tim is dead.</p><p>My personal rate of iteration back then was so slow, that I now evolve at least three times faster than before in as little as a few months.</p><p>The chaos gave me clarity. It forced me to see my blind spots. I had no option but to work on them or go broke, then woke, and end up back at a job.</p><h1>Reduce the gap between idea and action</h1><p>In the old world I used to have dreams.</p><ul><li><p>“When I retire at 65 I’ll buy a caravan.”</p></li><li><p>“When the kids are grown up Ill buy that black Mercedes.”</p></li><li><p>“We’ll save up and buy that dream house with the extra bedroom one day.”</p></li><li><p>“Just a few more years and we can take 3 months off to travel around Europe.”</p></li></ul><p>The gap between those ideas and taking action is gone. I no longer sit down and ma$turbate as most people do about what I’m gonna do like old man Sam. Nope.</p><p>I just freaking do it.</p><p>I have an idea and within an hour I’m already implementing it. I don’t wonder anymore. I let myself take action and let reality shape my views.</p><p>99% of people spend their whole lives dreaming and putting things off. When you adopt this go-to-war mindset the thinking time vanishes. You finally start to live life.</p><h1>Do hard things</h1><p>Sounds cliche as hell. All the bros are saying it. Damn hustle culture knobheads.</p><p>We hear this hard things phrase more and more because it’s true. Society has become soft. The bat virus taught us to stay at home all day in a bubble of comfort and fondle ourselves to Instagram super models while wearing our nicest silk pyjamas.</p><p>Going to war is hard. It requires a mission, direction, radical self-awareness, risks, and the ability to back yourself despite what every grandma in your life says about your idea.</p><p>“Don’t do that, it’ll never work,” they say. These same people have never done anything and wanna tell you that you can’t be anything. What a joke.</p><p>This quote from @ isabelunraveled comes to mind:</p><blockquote><p><em>"I didn't realize yet that the only definition of smart that really resonates with me is: the ability to get what you actually want in life."</em></p></blockquote><p>If you’re not already getting what you want out of life, then your advice means nothing to me. And you should adopt the same mantra in your life.</p><p>Going to war is about being on a different path.</p><p>It’s one where other humans can’t infect your brain with their comments, rejections, opinions, and values. It’s one where the culture war is turned off and politics is not even on your radar.</p><pre><code>The hard thing isn’t dreaming big. The hard thing is waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat when the dream turns into a nightmare. – Ben Horowitz</code></pre><h1>Final Thought</h1><p>Passion is a sign of weakness. Stop being fooled.</p><p>When you go to war and embrace the chaos everything in life gets better. Success doesn’t sound like a lottery ticket or <em>a pick me, pick me, pick me</em> Hollywood dream guarded by gatekeepers who require s3xual favors. No.</p><p>The path to success becomes obvious. It’s a lonely path because most people self-select themselves out of it. So the idea of competition is gone.</p><p>It becomes you vs. you. That’s the hardest war you’ll ever fight but you also have the most control. It’s a battle you can win every day.</p><p>Choose war, not passion.</p><p>Tell me which of these ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

I’d bought myself a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CbxWDHzPVsF/?img_index=2">second hand jeep and a couple of dog boxes</a>. As I headed off to get my very first dog, <a href="https://www.happydoggo.com/dog-stories/mr-fox">Mr Fox</a>, I was nervous and only had crazy dreams in my head. </p><p>What I do remember is how hard it was for 6-8 months I was doing them alone. I wanted to feel the pain, understand the problems and catch the dogs myself. I got bitten 3 times and crawled under many shacks and ran up hills and into rivers after dogs. I only managed to do 302 sterilisations in those first 8 months as I had to drive 2 per day to the vets myself. </p><p>That experience was absolutely crucial in forming my understanding of how hard it is but also how important this was for the dogs. In my local area I could see the small difference it was making. It was a lightbulb moment in my head. This was how you improved not just a few dozens lives but 1000s.</p><p>After those 8 months I decided to make a huge change. I would focus on raising money and awareness with <a href="https://www.happydoggo.com/">Happy Doggo</a> to accelerate sterilising both on Koh Samui and around the world. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png" width="1198" height="752" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:752,&quot;width&quot;:1198,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2086098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>A Huge Team Effort With Our Partners </h3><p>What I very quickly realised from sterilising the dogs myself was that it would be impossible to fix this problem alone. It is incredibly hard to catch dogs, interact with the community, get them operated on and return them safely. </p><p>We needed partners. We have two brilliant ones with <a href="https://robsdogs.net.au/">RDF</a> here on the island and <a href="https://www.soidog.org/">Soi Dog</a> nationally. We figured out the quickest way to get things done was to fund them both at scale and turbo charge the sterilising. </p><p>Seeing the Happy Doggo logo beside another charity and team work happening in the space to collectively help the dogs never gets old for me. You can do a little bit on your own but together as part of a team we can all achieve so much more. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png" width="1256" height="592" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:1256,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1644530,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>100% Coverage Is Impossible</h3><p>We can never get to all dogs sterilised in any given area for a number of reasons including…</p><ul><li><p>Some locals won’t allow their dogs to be done </p></li><li><p>Dog breeders who want to make money from puppies</p></li><li><p>Dogs being brought in by migrant workers</p></li></ul><p>By getting to 90-95% though it means the number of dogs suffering is decreasing massively.

Back In those days I could feel very worthless and life had little meaning. </p><p>Finding the dogs changed everything. I now wake up every morning and while looking in the mirror ask myself the question “if you died tomorrow is this what you want to be doing” and the answer is always overwhelmingly a yes. Nothing is more important than helping these dogs. </p><p>I remember clearly the feeling of fear heading out in that jeep wondering what on earth I was doing and how it seemed impossible to fix an entire island. But here we are. Koh Samui is done.</p><p>I now have the same fear about being able to fix all of Thailand or changing South East Asia as whole. At the back of my head I’m terrified that I have repeatedly said we would do this across the entire world. It seems absolutely impossible as a target but so did fixing a small island not so long ago. </p><p>Sometimes the numbers are easy to gloss over and comprehend their scale. I like to think of Tina when I’m looking at the spreadsheets and big numbers. In my mind its not just 6000 dogs but rather 6000 Tina’s we are funding to sterilise every month. That makes it very real in terms of grasping the enormity of it all. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp" width="790" height="494" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:790,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:54086,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>None of this would be possible without people supporting online or on the ground with the dogs.

Following our last subscriber-exclusive post on the sickest LSD tabs ever made—which you should <a href="https://ravenewworld.substack.com/p/8-lsd-blotters-that-defined-psychedelic">definitely peep</a> if you haven’t yet—I caught up with one of my favorite galaxy brains in the psychedelic game, Erik Davis, for a more in-depth interview about all things acid.  Further down we have links to my latest reporting on psychedelic news, a notable eco-rave coming up this weekend, and… streetwear-inspired fentanyl testing strips.

The occasion was the launch of <em>Blotter</em>—an illustrated book by countercultural scholar Erik Davis that charts the under-reported history of LSD blotter art. Blotters, in case you’re wondering, are highly-absorbent pieces of square paper that liquid acid is dropped on, and they are usually decorated with pop cultural iconography like flying saucers, cartoon characters, and other tongue-in-cheek or trippy images. The audience at the event did not disappoint: as I sat at the bar drinking Diet Cokes, an animated hippie sidled up and whispered RFK conspiracies in my ear. In the crowd, I spotted long-haired bikers in leather jackets covered in Grateful Dead pins, and at least one shirt that spelled out ERGOT in Greek letters.&nbsp;</p><p>Then the lights darkened and Davis took the stage in front of flashing images of the most iconic acid blotters ever made. By the late 70s, blotter had become the dominant method for distributing LSD, he explained. While their designs are easily written off as a form of illicit branding, Davis makes the case that this “ephemeral and snackable” medium amounts to more than just underground commercialism; rather, he writes, they are “material manifestations of a visionary and irascible subculture whose potent iconography demand(s) to be preserved.”&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png" width="840" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:882416,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mark McCloud at the Institute of Illegal Images (Photo <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/institute-of-illegal-images-lsd-art-16615568.php">via SF Gate</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Blotter </em>collects its material from a multitude of sources, including original interviews with (typically press-shy) LSD blotter-makers, as well as reports from the Drug Enforcement Agency, which ironically provide historically valuable and sometimes obsessive notes on which designs were showing up on the streets. Mostly, however, <em>Blotter </em>draws from the collection of Mark McCloud—a swashbuckling renegade who Davis met through the Bay Area psychedelic scene, and who has been collecting the world’s most beautiful and rarified acid blotters at his San Francisco museum, the Institute of Illegal Images.&nbsp;</p><p>McCloud eventually got up on stage next to Davis, his knuckles covered in gold rings. While Davis has the vibe of an elfish professor, McCloud’s eyes had the mischievous twinkle of a psychedelic pirate who has spent years battling the authorities that tried several times to arrest him and confiscate his collection. Later, Davis told me this book, more than any other he’s written, was infused with a sort of love: McCloud obsession with blotter art, Davis’ fondness for LSD, as well as their friendship with each other.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg" width="1200" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:253362,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">McCloud’s skull ring and pen were so swag I had to grab a pic of it… </figcaption></figure></div><p>I recently caught up with Davis, who was chilling in Northern California’s dankest county, Mendocino. We discussed some of the the coolest, wildest, and most next-level blotters ever made—<a href="https://ravenewworld.substack.com/p/8-lsd-blotters-that-defined-psychedelic">check them out here</a>. Below is our extended interview, which gets deeper into this idea of acid blotters as a form of countercultural <em>media</em>—as well as strange tales of chemists praying over LSD crystals and other deep lysergic lore. </p><p><strong>Michelle: Let’s start with this idea that acid is kind of a new </strong><em><strong>technology </strong></em><strong>that comes about in the early 70s.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Erik: One of the motivations for the book was to grapple with the particular and peculiar nature of LSD. Even though many of our narratives of the counterculture derived from the 1960s, there’s still a weird way in which we haven't really digested or reframed what that compound is.&nbsp;</p><p>LSD emerged in the West immediately in and after World War II. A whole set of new technologies, from television to radar, emerged from the craziness and absolute horror of WWII. LSD is part of that mix. When it shows up, it comes on as very contemporary and looks like technology, psychiatric medicine, and media, rather than an ancient expression of the gods drawn from plants. MK Ultra also happened to latch onto LSD, as it did many other drugs, so it’s carrying so many different ghosts, some of them really disturbing. That partly characterizes why it's such a weird and singular psychedelic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Acid has a lot of cultural baggage with a very fraught history within the counterculture. Is this book an attempt to situate it in a different way for our contemporary moment?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lot of people prefer plants with indigenous histories that don't seem so tainted. I was talking with a younger person who said they stayed away from LSD because it was associated with mind control! So yeah, I did want to turn around the story about LSD. Psychedelics are like spirits—they have a quality of animation, but they're not exactly alive. And the stories we tell about drugs help shape our experiences of them—they’re part of the set and setting.&nbsp;</p><p>LSD has literally worn all these images on its skin—and those images don’t really work like a logo or a brand. LSD is more like a one-page comic book, except it’s really tiny. It is an anomalous form of print media that has a relationship to other media, like psychedelic poster art. The book doesn’t talk about the experiences of LSD that much. It offers a different perspective than “this person did this, and here’s Timothy Leary, and here’s the Grateful Dead.” Those people are off to the side, because the hero is the printed matter itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I'm really glad you didn't get too much into the phenomenology of LSD, because there's nothing more boring than reading about someone’s trip! And it’s cool that you compare LSD to comic books, punk zines, and other forms of countercultural media. Is that why you call acid a “meta-media”?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You can put LSD on a piece of blotter paper, but you can put it on a capsule, a pill, matchsticks, a Pez… you can put it on anything. In legal discourse, you call these carrier mediums. If you have, for example, a gram of crystal LSD in powder form, you can put it on blotter paper or pills, which have different weights. A lot of the time, someone was sentenced based on the weight of the carrier medium. Which is why mid-range and even low-level LSD dealers got screwed.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is, blotter images are totally superfluous in this calculation. You don’t need it. The medium is a blotter paper, and everything on there is like a meta-medium—a bonus, an overtone, a vector, a reference, a joke, a wink, a sign of belonging. So I'm using that term “meta-medium” in a playful way.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg" width="1000" height="1003" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1003,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1542658,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">One of the notable acid tabs in Blotter</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>In the book, you write about how these images go beyond just putting your logo on something. Do you think there’s something about the acid blotter that transcends, or maybe elides, straightforward commercialism?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Obviously there's a major commercial element, and people do make a lot of money off of acid, but it's a very, very different trade than other drugs. It's mostly carried out semi-independently of other drug trafficking, and it doesn't involve a lot of big gangs. I'm not trying to overly romanticize it, but it has a different market logic. Another thing is, it doesn't really work as a brand for very long, because brands are very consistent. It's the same Advil I've looked at for 20 years. With acid blotters, if they become well-known, somebody can just copy them—there’s no intellectual property law.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, you're in the realm of the copy. We're going to replicate all these molecules, print multiple copies of the same image, soak them in LSD, and distribute them. So while we still might think about it in terms of branding, it has a different kind of logic than what we mean by brands or trademarks.</p><p><strong>I learned a lot from this book. You have this really interesting story about how Nick Sand and Tim Scully [makers of Orange Sunshine, possibly the most famous batch of LSD ever made] put the same batch of acid on different colored tabs, and a lore grew on the streets that the different colors had different effects. But in fact, it was all the same LSD. I feel like this happens so often today, where people attribute specific attributes to certain blotters of acid, as if they were like different weed strains.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is the problem of the copy. Is the copy always the same? If you keep xeroxing it over and over again, it starts to change. If you get into the more esoteric issue, it’s like, what makes different batches of LSD different from one another? Some people are like, sorry, man, it's just LSD. It's a molecule, so you can make it more clean or less clean, and it might have stuff in it with psychoactive effects that affects the quality. But a lot of other people are going to be like, there's something mysterious about what makes a batch of LSD particularly good. And then you get into the mystical side, where people like Owsley and Sand would sing songs and do prayers over the LSD crystals. They wanted to be fully present for this material transformation that would launch hundreds of thousands of people’s experiences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yeah, this is where acid culture really converges with New Age woo-woo. But when it comes to that kind of magical thinking, I do actually buy the idea that the art on the blotter is part of set and setting, and that our mindsets can be shifted by the images we look at before tripping.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Well, if I'm at a ritual, and I'm going to drink ayahuasca out of a styrofoam coffee cup versus a beautiful carved chalice with a dragon on it, that's a different experience. It’s a way to go, OK, this medicine is entering into me now, through this portal, this vehicle, this expression, this ritual. Well, the same thing applies to the images on the blotter paper. So you're right, this is a more concrete place where we see the magic of iconography operating as a kind of hint, flavor, perfume, or almost like a spell—because they have that kind of shift.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The legality around acid is really severe, and that is part of why the acid trade is so secretive. At least in my reporting, I’ve found it so hard to access the higher levels of the acid supply chain. But you have some really amazing stories of blotter makers and other people near the top. How did you access these stories?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hats off to Mark McCloud. A lot of the material is based on stories, experiences, and personal contacts that Mark has had over the decades since he started to collect the blotters, and eventually becoming a blotter-maker himself in the 1990s. He had a decade of underground work that allowed him to meet many people, and he also collected some written interviews in his archive.&nbsp;</p><p>So the stories in the book are pretty close to the horse's mouth, and that's part of what makes it lore. We also were able to interview some people directly who he knew, and therefore we could approach. Sometimes they said yes, other times they said get the hell away from me. But you need somebody who’s no longer doing it, and who’s at the edge of the blackmarket. They’re also going to be cagey about a lot of details.&nbsp;</p><p>One advantage of this book is that I wasn’t talking about the manufacturing or upper-level distribution of acid, except in general terms. As you say, there’s a lot of obfuscation in the LSD world for very good reason: it's been largely successful, with a few exceptions. Major LSD lab busts have been extremely rare for 70 years. But a lot of blotter-makers were quasi-independent, so they only made the blotter. Sometimes they laid it out, but oftentimes somebody else would take it and deal with it. So they were separate enough that some were happy to tell their tale.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:234883,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mark McCloud and Erik Davis signing books at the Berkeley Alembic (Photo via Erik Davis) </figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>I caught a whiff of McCloud’s flavor at the book launch, but I’d love to hear more about what a character he is.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This project came out of the fact that I had a friendship with Mark that went back to the early 2000s, when we met on the scene. In a lot of ways, of all the projects I've done, this was the one that was most about love, because it was about his love of LSD and my love of LSD, and it was also about our friendship. He's one of my best friends.</p><p>I always just really enjoyed his combination of good humor, full of stories, doesn't take himself seriously, has a pirate edge of raw intensity. He’s also a big character who knows everybody. So when I asked him to do this, he already trusted me. Trust is the singular value of this underground. It’s almost a real religious value, not in a negative sense, but in the sense that, inside of the criminal LSD underground, ratting on people is much worse than in our normie life, that kind of betrayal. Mark has a very high ethical standard, and he's quite a gentleman, even though he's a rascal.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing about him is that he has certain ways of telling stories where there's layers of indirection. So you have to hang around a lot. I had to go over and over and over the same stories to crystallize history out of a raconteur’s lore, and that required a lot of patience. I&nbsp;learned early on not to smoke the weed.</p><p><strong>Yeah, only smoke after the interview!&nbsp;</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>📝 TRIP REPORTS </h2><p><em>I’ve started reporting on psychedelic news for DoubleBlind magazine as their newly-appointed Culture Editor!

According to the brand’s creative director, their packaging designs aim to look “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91194573/overdrive-harm-reduction-test-strips">native to party culture</a>,” which I guess means that they look like cigarettes? I’m not sure how to feel about test strips getting co-opted into a form of lifestyle branding, but I also had a feeling this would happen back when I wrote about “Suck Dick Carry Narcan”<a href="https://ravenewworld.substack.com/p/suck-dick-carry-narcan"> for The Guardian</a> back in 2021!

And it’s really just a piece of clip art that the designer got from the internet. It’s based on Albert Hoffman’s famous bicycle ride after he first synthesized LSD. The designer worked at Paradiso club in Amsterdam in the 70s, and made a lot of their posters. One of the things you might not notice is that the numbers are silk screened on top of an offset printed image, which are usually not combined. He did that to make it harder to copy. And he added glitter to some of the numbers too, so people couldn’t just steal the design.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also just a great image of acid. I just love that sense of movement and dynamism of the bike. It seems very appropriate for LSD’s sense of movement and dynamism, and the modernity of it.” </p><h4>2. ‘Japanese Crests (reissue),’ original by Bernard Hassall (mid 1980s) </h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg" width="1000" height="999" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:999,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1322428,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“This was a mid-1980s reissue of an earlier sheet of acid, known on the street as “samurais” and based in <em>Monsho: Family Crests for Symbolic Design</em> by Isao Honda. They were made by Bernard Hassall, who was friends with Terence McKenna and was busted. He was particularly artistic in his approach to making blotter, and the originals were a series of Japanese seals protected by a shiny black cover. These sheets came in a box, and one had a higher dose than the others. That one was touched in gold so the user would recognize the difference. The manufacturer, Leonard Picard, did a number of high-quality issues in the 80s and this was one of them.” </p><h4>3. ‘Camouflage’ by Sarah Matzar (mid-1980s) </h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg" width="1000" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2349917,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“This one is by Sarah Matzar, a woman who was involved in an LSD family in the Grateful Dead scene that was one of the core upper-crust crews. It was a family called the Bolinas girl gang, because they were mostly women. She's very much still around, and went through some legal trials; she definitely paid her dues. This is one of her designs, and she also wove quilts, so one of their code names for acid blotter was “quilts.” I like the fact that it’s abstract, and that’s it’s pink.

He has previously invested in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210615005584/en/Exscientia-Acquires-Personalised-Medicine-AI-Pioneer-Allcyte">Allcyte</a>, <a href="https://www.cradle.bio/">Cradle</a>, <a href="https://www.envedabio.com/">Enveda</a>, and <a href="https://seqera.io/">Seqera</a>, among others. Before starting his own fund, Manuel was part of <a href="https://www.kry.se/en/">KRY</a> and <a href="https://earlybird.com/">Earlybird</a> Venture Capital among others.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoryvladimer/">Gregory Vladimer</a> was the CSO and scientific co-founder of Allcyte, which he exited to <a href="https://www.exscientia.com/">Exscientia</a>, one of the leading public TechBio companies. He is currently the co-founder and CEO of a new TechBio startup, Graph Therapeutics, in the immunology and inflammation space, and he is also a TechBio advisor for Merantix..</p><h1><strong>2. Understanding TechBio</strong></h1><h2><strong>Defining characteristics of TechBio, and how they changed</strong></h2><p>Manuel describes TechBio as “<strong>an umbrella term for founder-led, software- and engineering-driven innovation in biotechnology,</strong>" encompassing pharma, material science, and agriculture.</p><blockquote><p>📌 <em>As the case of Gregory and Allcyte highlights, the essence of TechBio lies in the intention of the founding teams: to <strong>build a technology platform</strong> that is tightly <strong>coupled with advancing scientific progress in the laboratory</strong>, and geared towards disrupting drug discovery and development</em></p></blockquote><p>At its core, TechBio describes companies that deeply integrate aspects that traditionally define technology companies (i.e., the classic tech startup world) with those that typically define biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and related companies (i.e., big pharma and small biotech startups). This can be achieved in various ways, <strong>from building computational tools and infrastructure only to developing fully integrated loops between technology platforms and wet labs</strong> (laboratories where scientists conduct experiments involving chemicals, biological matter, or other substances, typically requiring liquid handling and physical equipment). This is demonstrated by Amino Collective’s portfolio companies, with <a href="https://seqera.io/">Seqera</a> being an example of a purely software-focused company and <a href="https://www.envedabio.com/">Enveda Biosciences</a> striking a balance between their software and wet lab components.</p><p>As Gregory noted, the definition of TechBio has evolved in multiple phases:</p><ul><li><p>In its 1.0 phase, pharmaceutical companies attempted to develop and integrate software platforms internally.</p></li><li><p>In its 2.0 phase, companies like <a href="https://www.exscientia.com/">Exscientia</a> and <a href="https://www.recursion.com/">Recursion</a> emerged to build horizontal tech stacks, but have biotech builds through internal pipelines</p></li><li><p>The current 3.0 phase revolves around a synergistic integration of technology platforms and biology, <strong>creating a tightly coupled feedback loop between the two</strong>.<br></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>💡 <em>Achieving these bi-directional feedback loops <strong>prevents cannibalization</strong> (diverting resources from tech development to therapeutics) of one over the other and ensures that both advance in lockstep.</em></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Anatomy of a TechBio company, and how it evolves over time</strong></h2><p>As both Manuel and Gregory pointed out, TechBio companies look fundamentally different from biotech companies, especially in the initial stages.</p><p>Biotechs are oriented around fundamental science. From day one, traditional biotech tends to rely on a pre-defined <strong>set of tangible assets, like differentiated science and defensible intellectual property</strong>. Overall, the underlying scientific asset base usually remains relatively fixed. Furthermore, regulations restrict the biotech’s option space and pre-determine its path to a significant degree. As a result of the fixed asset base and the limited option space, the founding team becomes less relevant and is usually replaced with seasoned executives relatively early on.</p><p>This is very different for TechBio, which is <strong>dominated by software- and engineering principles in addition to fundamental science</strong>. Here, the technology stack and the scientific assets are highly dynamic and evolve over time. The developed technology platforms aim to <strong>generate novel scientific assets, resulting in an evolving asset portfolio</strong>. As a result, the strategic option space is much wider, requiring a <strong>founding team that is adaptive, agile, fast-learning, and decisive</strong> enough to make decisions and lead the company.</p><blockquote><p>📌<em> Due to TechBio companies starting by focusing on building their technology stack, their initial trajectory looks closer to a technology company than a biotech.</em></p></blockquote><p>However, for some TechBio companies, the trajectory can evolve drastically.</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>This evolution occurs when a company decides to keep its platform for itself and <strong>create its own pipeline of therapeutic assets</strong> rather than providing its technology platform to third parties.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>In this case, there is a <strong>step-function change where the anatomy of the company shifts from TechBio towards biotech</strong>, as its value is largely driven by the value of its pipeline of assets. In this case, a company may have raised its initial funding as a TechBio startup and then raised follow-on funding from more traditional biotech investors.</p><p>More information on the difference between Tech Bio and Biotech companies in <a href="https://www.baybridgebio.com/blog/anatomy_of_a_decacorn">this article </a>from <a href="https://www.baybridgebio.com">Bay Bridge Bio</a>.</p><h1><strong>3. The TechBio Model</strong></h1><h2><strong>Archetypes of TechBio companies</strong></h2><p>TechBio can refer to many types of companies with different focus, the most prevalent being infrastructure to aid human workflows and computational biology for drug development.</p><blockquote><p>📌 <em>Their business models could include: SaaS models for externally-facing platforms, tailored services, Contract Research Organization-like models, and models focused on asset generation through internally-developed, proprietary tech platforms, partnerships between the platform techbio company and other players with deep expertise or IP and related areas like specific indications.</em></p></blockquote><p>As Gregory pointed out, the companies that use their platform to generate their own assets can be largely defined by <strong>whether they advance their assets in-house, co-develop them with partners, or licence them out entirely</strong>.</p><p>Manuel noted that focusing on purely providing tools as products and services can often be challenging since the exit potential tops out in the low hundreds of millions in most cases, which <strong>can make a company misaligned with the VC model</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>He thus suggests&nbsp; that companies <strong>consider  an asset-heavy model that allows them to participate in the potential upside of their platform</strong> (like Schrödinger, which moved from tooling to building their own pipeline) or <strong>expand horizontally across different customer segments</strong> to manage a single, very specific workflow (e.g., Seqera). With this in mind, it is important to mention there are a lot of companies that don’t fit these two ways and are still successful.&nbsp;</em></p><p></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Fundamental methodology for building in TechBio</strong></h2><p>TechBio companies should emphasise speed, agility, and fast iteration cycles that are informed by engineering principles. According to Gregory, the goal of companies focused on generating their own assets should be to create a “<strong>lab in the loop,</strong>” where there is a bi-directional reinforcing feedback loop between the technology stack and the laboratory and insights from one fuel the other in a highly synergistic and direct way.</p><p>💡 To achieve this:</p><ul><li><p>Team → TechBio companies must create an aligned team of tech and bio talent that learns to develop a common language, starts to rely on each other, and operates as <strong>a shared unit that feeds into each other in both directions</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Tech Stack → Gregory mentioned how important it is to remember that <strong>building a robust and scalable tech stack can be crucial not just for product quality but also for potential acquisitions</strong>, as was the case with Allcyte when it was acquired by Exscientia.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>IP → It is crucial for TechBio firms to <strong>protect their scientific assets and technology platforms</strong>.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2><strong>Types of de-risking</strong></h2><blockquote><p><strong>？Why is it important:​</strong> De-risking is particularly vital for TechBio ventures because these companies operate at the intersection of technology and biology, where the stakes are inherently high. By focusing on de-risking, investors can gain confidence in the venture's ability to deliver tangible outcomes and navigate the complexities of scaling both technology and biotech assets.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Scientific validation</strong></h3><p><strong>Commercial validation</strong> is critical in TechBio, but <strong>academic publications</strong> matter, too, because they reflect scientific milestones that imply significant de-risking to investors, as has been demonstrated by Gregory and the case of Allcyte, and Graph. Scientific validation may generally take the shape of in-vitro molecular validation, models and simulations, publications, clinical studies, and literature.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png" width="1456" height="821" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7468d949-9275-4268-855b-34c8f9aaf41e_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>Building partnerships</strong></h3><p>Developing relationships in TechBio takes time, but the <strong>frequent movement of talent within the pharma industry allows for the establishment of connections</strong> with various firms over time. Key activities for building relationships include publishing papers, presenting posters, and giving talks. Additionally, <strong>creating a community within your niche</strong>, even across different geographies, is crucial. This helps establish a compelling narrative around your company.</p><h3><strong>Balanced resource allocation, throughout anatomical change</strong></h3><p>TechBio companies must strike a balance between developing their technology platform and assets and revenue generation. They must <strong>deploy enough resources to continuously develop their technology stack to remain state-of-the-art while generating and advancing potential assets</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>📌 <em>Once TechBio companies have generated their own assets, they constantly face the risk of either cannibalising their technology stack or starving their therapeutic assets of necessary support.</em></p></blockquote><p>In the past, TechBio companies often neglected their therapeutic assets. Greg recommended that companies <strong>clearly allocate resources for each area</strong> and <strong>make extremely data-driven fundraising decisions at this stage</strong>.</p><p>During this stage, it becomes extremely important to approach the anatomical change of the company from TechBio towards biotech strategically and consider different approaches to positioning the company and raise, according to both Manuel and Greg. Greg also laid out two different options:</p><ol><li><p>Spinning off biotech assets from the main company that holds the tech platform</p></li><li><p>Keeping both the biotech assets and the tech platform inside the same legal entity.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>💡 <em>This decision will influence the types of investors and funding available to the company. Greg mentioned that, in any case, <strong>the most crucial part is ensuring that all shareholders are fairly rewarded when an exit of an asset or the entire company occurs, regardless of the chosen path</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><h1><strong>4. Investing in TechBio</strong></h1><h2><strong>TechBio companies expectations from an investor’s perspective</strong></h2><p>While some companies consider spinning off their assets, Manuel pointed out that, from an early-stage investor perspective, <strong>one would want all the gains to be accrued in the same legal entity rather than have assets</strong>, except in the case of assets that are spun off or out-licensed for strategic reasons or resource constraints.</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>Here, Gregory emphasized again that in the case of having a single entity for both the tech platform and the scientific assets, <strong>ring-fencing and continuously investing in the tech platform is crucial</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Capital efficiency and availability in Europe</strong></h2><p>According to Manuel, the assumption that European TechBio startups will be more capital-efficient than their US counterparts may not hold true in the longer term. He pointed out that <strong>valuations are already roughly the same</strong> when looking at London and major hubs in the US like Boston and San Francisco and that those <strong>companies are built with a very global perspective from day one</strong>. However, he mentioned that there may be a continued arbitrage between continental Europe and the US.</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>In particular, he stated that most TechBio companies require around 8 - €12M in funding to get to a significant Series A. Consequently, Amino Collective strongly emphasises building strong syndicates that can support companies&nbsp; until their Series A and beyond.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>📌 Additionally, it is important to note that capital requirements for platforms and pipelines are vastly greater than those for externally-facing platforms that are monetized as SaaS.</em></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Why focus on TechBio now</strong></h2><p>Throughout the session, Manuel pointed to two main reasons as to why investors should focus on TechBio now: the trends inherent in the TechBio space and the perspective of Limited Partners (LPs) investing in VC funds.</p><blockquote><p>📌 <em>The TechBio space benefits from two fundamental tailwinds related to <strong>technological advancements and market demand</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>On the one hand, <strong>Machine Learning enables fundamentally novel capabilities, the creation of new categories, and drastic productivity increases</strong>. On the other hand, <strong>pharma companies are increasingly adopting software platforms </strong>, resulting in significant demand and increasing budgets for cloud-based software platforms, making Amino Collective particularly bullish on infrastructure plays.</p><p>On the LP side, Manuel recounted that, before the COVID-19 pandemic, potential LPs thought that investing in seed stage bio ompanies would be a “bridge to nowhere,” as no investors would finance TechBio companies beyond Series A. However, Manuel stated that this has changed fundamentally, with <strong>LPs now being aware of the potential for TechBio in Europe</strong>.</p><h1><strong>5. Outlook</strong></h1><h2><strong>The next frontiers for TechBio</strong></h2><p>Gregory made a strong case that <strong>all stages of research need to be disrupted by tech - from the early pre-clinical stages to translational research</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>📌 <em>At each step of the way, we need to make sure that additional, meaningful data is provided to shed light on and de-risk major decision and investment points of drug development. For this, pre-clinical data must provide clinically realistic insights and clinical data must be fed back into the earlier stages so that a bi-directional feedback loop emerges between early- and late-stage research.</em></p></blockquote><p>While Manuel is particularly excited about infrastructure-focused plays targeting pharma and biotech companies, Gregory is enthusiastic about <strong>precision immunology and creating a platform that generates immunology targets</strong>, which is also what his new company is dedicated to.</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>Gregory also extrapolated that if current trends continue, Europe will soon move from existing platforms, i.e., entire companies, to exiting individual assets only so that the <strong>companies retain their platforms and continue to operate.</strong></em></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Ecosystem</strong></h2><p>As Manuel highlighted, the European TechBio ecosystem benefits from several tailwinds.</p><ul><li><p>A number of translation and TechBio-oriented scientist communities focused on teaching scientists how to spin out their research have emerged. Examples of those communities are <a href="https://www.nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, <a href="https://www.bitsinbio.org/">Bits in Bio</a>, and <a href="https://igem.org/">iGEM</a>.</p></li><li><p>In addition, talent is starting to leave successful Techbio companies to start their own startups i.e.&nbsp; Owkin, Oxford Nanopore, and Exscientia.</p></li><li><p>And lastly, London is becoming a global hub for AI + bio, with many companies being present in the London ecosystem and a number of acquisitions having taken place there.</p></li></ul><h1><strong>6. Key takeaways:</strong></h1><p>☂️ TechBio has become an umbrella term for <strong>founder-led, software- and engineering-driven biotech companies</strong>. It combines defining aspects of both tech and biotech companies.</p><p>📈 A TechBio company developing an internal therapeutic pipeline will need to undergo a <strong>fundamental change to be venture-backable</strong>. It starts as a tech company building a software platform and becomes a biotech company upon creating an internal therapeutics pipeline, presenting a challenge to founders and investors.</p><p>♻️ Startups that combine a wet lab and a software platform should create a <strong>“lab in the loop,”</strong> where the platform and lab are tightly coupled to form a <strong>bi-directional feedback loop</strong>.</p><p>⚖️ TechBio companies need to <strong>create synergies and strike a balance between investing in the technology stack versus the internal pipeline</strong>, ensuring that each isn’t resource-starved.</p><p>❓ It is yet unclear whether companies should keep their assets as part of the main company or spin them off into subsidiaries. However, <strong>alignment between founders and investors</strong> is key. Investors must understand whether a company will predominantly <strong>accrue value through its tech platform or scientific assets before they invest</strong>.</p><p>🇪🇺 <strong>Europe’s TechBio ecosystem is gaining traction</strong>, as demonstrated by the emergence of communities like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nucleatehq/">Nucleate</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bits-in-bio/">Bits in Bio</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/igem-foundation/">iGEM</a>.</p><p>Room for Discussion:</p><p>👉 Manuel closed the session with the following question: “<strong>How can we make sure that scientists want to launch companies instead of joining existing companies and labs? </strong>We invite you to have a think of it and leave us a comment of this newsletter!</p><h1><strong>7.

Šiandien su jumis norėčiau pakalbėti apie tiesą. Ar jūs kaip rašytojas esate melavęs?</strong>Man tiesa yra labai svarbu ir aš niekada nemeluoju savo tekstuose. Tikiuosi, abu suprantame, kad jaunystėje klaidų buvo. Nesu išvaizdus. Tekdavo per rašymą sekso užsitarnauti. Kai rašai, kad gautum sekso, tai ne melas, tai gyvenimo pagražinimas. </p><p>Aišku, būdavo tokių merginų, kurios sakydavo, kad aš joms melavau. Mano meilės, eilėraštis išspausdintas laikraštyje be konkretaus vardo, juk tinka visoms. Ir Mildai, ir Danutei, ir Vitai, ir Monikai, ir dar daug kitų moterų. Negi Indrei sakydamas, kad eilėraštis skirtas jai, turiu visas kitas išvardinti? </p><p><strong>Taip, manau, logiška būtų.<br></strong>Ir man atrodo logiška, kad kai Indrė mane apjuodina ir vadina manipuliatoriumi aš turiu teisę jai atsikirsti. </p><p><strong>Bet ji, skirtingai nei jūs, nerašė apie jus straipsnio. Tik pasipasakojo artimiems draugams.</strong></p><p>Čia tik smulkmenos. Aš, kaip rašytojas, negaliu atsikirsti faktais. Faktus palieku mokslui. Man moka, kad aš fantazuočiau. Nuo kada fantazija yra melas? Galų gale, nuo venerinių ligų niekas nėra apsaugotas, tik todėl, kad Indrė pirmoji sugalvojo pasitikrinti nereiškia, kad aš ją ir užkrėčiau. </p><p><strong>Šiaip gydytojai gali nustatyti ligos platintoją.<br></strong>Ko tu prie tų ligų užsiciklinai? Žinoma, būna kartais, kad ir dabar koks nekaltas melas išsprūsta. Praeitą savaitę Anykščių lajų take vieną medį apgraužė bebras. Negi taip ir rašysi, ypač kai portalo redaktorius užsišikęs, reikia kelti skaitomumą. Parašiau “Anykščių savivaldybei nerūpi žmonių saugumas”. Medis gali nuvirsti? Gali? Gali prispausti žmogų? Gali.  </p><p><strong>Bet savivaldybėje dirba Indrės dabartinis vyras.<br></strong>Ir kas? Visi žino, kad aš buvau su Indre ir, kad ten dirba tas jos vyras. Jeigu nebūčiau parašęs, žmonės galvotų, kad žodžio laisvė neegzistuoja arba, kad aš esu bailys.</p><p>Mano profesijoje dar labai svarbu pagarba. Ypač reklamos užsakovams. </p><p><strong>Gal galite pabaigti tą su savivaldybe?<br></strong>Jau baigiau. Turėjau vieną incidentą, kai  mane apkaltino, kad melavau dėl lošimų. Nemelavau, o nutylėjau. Kalbėdamas su savo seneliu nutyliu, kad netikiu į Dievą. Tai ne melas, tai senelio širdelės apsauga. Senelis vis dar duoda man pinigų, lažybų bendrovės irgi. Neimdamas iš senelio pinigų irgi jį skaudinčiau. Šeimos vertybes reikia nešti į viešumą. Kodėl turiu skirstyti pagarbą? Mūsų pasaulyje ir taip per mažai pagarbos vieni kitiems.</p><p>Va, artėja rinkimai. Atrodo perpjaus vieni kitiems gerkles. Parašiau, kad Algis sutvarkė kanalizaciją Rėvos kaime. Kai supuolė visi ant manęs kaip vanagai. </p><p><strong>Bet Algis yra Indrės vyro konkurentas? O kanalizacija visoje Lietuvoje planinis remontas pagal Europos Sąjungos programą.<br></strong>Koks skirtumas, kad kanalizacija iš Europos Sąjungos. Dėkoti Europos Sąjungai tas pats, kas dėkoti – dangui. Geram rašymui reikia konkretumo. Jeigu nors vienas žmogus padėkos kitam, čia jau pliusas.</p><p>Be to, mano skaitytojai, netikrina nei faktų, nei informacijos šaltinių. Juk sutinkame, kad tokie žmonės turi teisę egzistuoti? Tai kodėl rašytojai, maitinantys tokius žmones, yra blogiečiai? <br>Aš nesuprantu iš kur tas noras rašytojus versti laikytis sugalvotų standartų, netinkančių niekur kitur. Pažiūrėčiau kiek ilgai išsilaikytų, pavyzdžiui, batų gamintojai jeigu gamintų tik savo dydžių batus. Va, mano koja kem penkta ir gaminu tik kem penkto dydžio batus. Nesąmonė.</p><p><strong>Bet juk rašytojai, žurnalistai turi turėti kažkokį moralinį stuburą. Vesti žmones pirmyn.<br></strong>Tai mes ir vedame žmones pirmyn. Juk tas projektas kur kartu rašėme.</p><p><strong>Čia dabar ne apie mus, o apie jus kalbame.<br></strong>Tai nežinau ar labai etiška į komandą pakviesti žmogų su negalia ir jam nemokėti, vien tam, kad gautume daugiau taškų pildydami paramos paraišką.</p><p><strong>Mes jam mokėjome!<br></strong>Tris kartus mažiau nei visiems kitiems.</p><p><strong>Darius būtų tiesiog namie sėdėjęs ir nieko negavęs. Mes gerą darbą padarėme.<br></strong>Be projekto tu pats būtum darbo biržoje sėdėjęs ir nelegaliai statybose dirbęs.</p><p><strong>Taip ir žinojau, kad su tais arogantiškais rašytojais net neverta kalbėtis.</strong></p><p></p><p>Šią savaitę galim susitikti Uršulės Toleikytės knygos <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1211789639941371">pristatyme trečiadienį:</a></p><div

I discovered a goldmine of micro life hacks on a Reddit thread called “Life Pro Tips,” that you can put into action without too much effort.</p><p>They’re awesome rule-of-thumbs that will save you time, money, and make you more sociable.</p><h1><strong>Say yes to more invites</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>As an adult if new friends invite you to something say, “Yes.” — Vanguard Anon</em></p></blockquote><p>Children get lots of opportunities to make new friends. </p><p>As adults they don’t come around as often. One of my good friends went through a brutal divorce last year. We tried to invite him to lots of social events. He rarely says yes and prefers to play computer games.</p><p>We keep inviting him anyway because occasionally he says yes. The last time he came with us he made a new friend. </p><p>That new friend has since started going on bike rides with him that has got him out of the house. We’ve noticed he’s losing weight, looking fresher, and in a better mood since.</p><p>Don’t underestimate the power of new friends. Say yes to random invitations and you’ll meet new, interesting people.</p><h1><strong>Think of everything you do as progress</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Sent someone a meme? You progressed your relationship. Drew a doodle? You progressed your art skill. Took a bath? You progressed your mental health.</em></p><p><em>Life is a bank and any time you do anything that brings you joy you’re earning.</em></p><p><em>— Mew Brew</em></p></blockquote><p>The reason why many of us have phases in life where we feel like we’re making no progress is because we make things too big in our heads.</p><p>Of course if your goal is to make 7-figures in a year you probably won’t achieve it. But you can sell one book for $20, even if it’s to your mother. Or you can send one sales email, even if nobody reads it.</p><p>It’s important to tell yourself after every small action that you’re making progress towards a goal. That self-talk helps give you self-fulfilling motivation — a type of motivation that will compound enormously over a year or more.</p><h1><strong>The weekend is where your future is built</strong></h1><blockquote><p>Use the weekend to build the life you want, instead of trying to escape the life you have — Bigger_ThanLife</p></blockquote><p>When I worked a job I hated, the weekend was my escape.</p><p>I did anything I could to numb the pain. The problem is it got me nowhere. I’d be right back to hell at 9 am on Monday morning. That’s when I learned to build after hours. We’re talking micro hacks, though, so hear me out.</p><p>Do 15 minutes of a new side project every weekend. Do it for 21 days to make it a habit. Every weekend add another 15 minutes. Within a few months you’ll slowly be transitioning from the life you hate to a new life with loads more possibilities. Quick transformations don’t work.</p><p>Slow transformations that start out as 15 minutes feel effortless. Effortless turns into action. Action changes your future.</p><h1><strong>Take pictures every day with your phone</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>You may not like being in pictures or taking them, but you will hate that you have no photos of some time period when you’re older.</em></p><p><em>Take pictures even if it is out of your comfort zone occasionally, for your future self — Squaragus_Asparagus</em></p></blockquote><p>I haven’t admitted this before so here goes… </p><p>In 2011, I went from 60 KGs to over 100 KGs in weight, thanks to a personal trainer. I thought muscles would help me attract women. It did the opposite.</p><p>When I tell people this story the first thing they ask is “can you show me a photo?” I didn’t take a lot of photos back then as I was in a deep, dark depression and hated myself. The idea of taking photos of myself felt stupid.</p><p>Now I regret it.</p><p>During the lockdowns caused by the global health crisis, I decided to make a change. I took multiple photos (even ones with masks) to remind myself of one of the most difficult times in human history. Now I have photos to show my future post-apocalypse children.</p><p>Photos are memories. Take plenty. Keep them off Instagram.</p><h1><strong>Be awesome to non-drinkers</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>If you offer someone an alcoholic drink and they say no, immediately tell them what non-alcoholic drinks you have. With no judgment.</em></p><p><em>They don’t owe you any explanation of recovery, medical contraindications, or whether or not they just don’t feel like it that day. — Lemjne</em></p></blockquote><p>I haven’t had an alcoholic drink for years.</p><p>Too many times alcohol has ruined my life.</p><p>So I stay away from it but it’s bloody hard. When I worked a regular job one of the hardest things was going to a social event and being asked “do you want beer or wine, mate?”</p><p>The truly awesome people would then follow up with “can I get you a soda or a sparkling mineral water?” The knob heads would keep asking why I didn’t drink. They’d accidentally embarrass me in front of an audience.</p><p>Explaining why you don’ drink is deeply personal.</p><p>I gave up due to a near-miss with cancer, my bad behavior around women when drunk, and the impulses to drink too much when life became unbearable. Explaining that in front of your boss or to a person on a first date with you is hard.</p><p>Quickly offer non-drinkers the non-alcoholic beverage options. They’ll love you for it and you’ll increase the chances of connecting with new people.</p><h1><strong>Ask this polite question in job interviews</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>From here on out, make “What was your company’s 2020 response?” a standard interview question. — PhasmaFelis</em></p></blockquote><p>Many companies did a terrible job in 2020 after the global health crisis. They treated us like bugs they could crush with their army boots.</p><p>How employers handle people during the tough times says a lot about them. If you’re deciding on a new employer and discover they did mass layoffs in March 2020, run a million miles away from them.</p><p>Compassion is the new business trend.</p><p>Every company that doesn’t get it will be scratching their heads and saying “why is it so hard to hire people?” Screw them.</p><p>They deserve it for being evil to humans.</p><h1><strong>Use this to avoid the death spiral into a useless conversation about politics</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Next time you are stuck in a conversation about politics, ask the person “what is your supported political party doing for you?” — Roboboy3000</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png" width="600" height="419" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:419,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image Credit–Sara Tasker via <a href="https://twitter.com/meandorla/status/1325766630266298368?s=20">Twitter</a> (WARNING: image used for demonstration only and does not reflect my political beliefs)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Most political talk leads nowhere.</p><p>It turns into a character assassination based on emotions rather than facts. Our politicians are out of touch with reality. A large proportion of them are white males over 70. It’s no wonder we lack a diversity of thought. This will hopefully change, but for now, it’s a long road.</p><p>Vote when the time comes. Don’t get too caught up in it. Instead, work on yourself. No politician is going to save you from inflation, or bring down the cost of your bills, or help you get a job. That’s the harsh truth.</p><h1><strong>Pretend other drivers are your grandmother</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>When you don’t have all the facts, try to give people the most generous reason you can for their behavior.</em></p><p><em>Annoyingly slow driver? Maybe it’s a mom with a birthday cake in the back. This mindset will gradually make you less reactive, more compassionate and more forgiving of your own bad days.</em></p><p><em>— ContributionNarrow88</em></p></blockquote><p>I used to be a road rage maniac. I’d ride up the asses of every car on the freeway and scream “get out of my way, pal!”</p><p>That’s what deep anxiety sounds like.</p><p>In recent years I’ve used this life hack to think of other drivers as my grandmother. When she used to drive me around I’d be patient, forgive her when she made wrong turns, and be more helpful.</p><p>Grandma died a few years ago.</p><p>Her legacy lives on through the way I’ve decided to treat other drivers. All of the blowing up at drivers used to drain my energy. Now I’m just a Sunday driver in a lawn bowls outfit and candy pink visor hat, sharing the roads with my fellow grandmothers and grandfathers.</p><p>Takeaway: If you knew that annoying person had just left the hospital to farewell the love of their life after dying from cancer, would you be so cruel? Of course not. Try to think that way about everyone you meet.</p><h1><strong>Do the phone survey and unlock a hidden reward</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>If you’re asked to take a survey after a service rep/tech helps you out, take it and give them the best score possible— Stoncils</em></p></blockquote><p>I spent a good part of my career working in call centers. I had to ask every caller to do a survey.</p><p>Many of them would say no or hang up. It broke my heart.</p><p>They didn’t know how important it was. I had a KPI on how many surveys I got done. And if they left me a positive comment at the end it would get read out in team meetings.</p><p>One customer left me such a good comment after the survey that it got shared with thousands of my colleagues at a town hall meeting by our General Manager. As a result of that feedback I met my future boss who got me out of the call center and into a job I loved.</p><p>Customer service reps could do with your help. It takes 30 seconds and can help ensure they don’t have to work in the same job forever. Completing a survey is the gift of an opportunity.</p><p>You unlock the hidden reward of knowing you made a customer service rep’s day. Try it.</p><p><em>This final life hack is from me…</em></p><h1><strong>Don’t write controversial words on social media</strong></h1><p>It can get you banned and the platform’s machine learning/algorithms are trained to look for them.</p><p>You could be smacked in the face by the nanny police for trying to innocently share your story. They won’t tell you either. They’ll either block your content or shadow-ban you.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li><p>S*x</p></li><li><p>Coroni-rona</p></li><li><p>P*rn</p></li></ul><p>Instead, just substitute the controversial word for one that has the same meaning and won’t trigger the nannies. Here’s an example: “fuggit.” (Hat tilt to Sean Kernan.) See, you know what I’m saying, don’t you? Nice.</p><p>Until the web becomes decentralized this is what we have to deal with.

They refuse to take risks. They won’t consider a different point of view. They refuse to change. So their body ages but their “self” stays the same age.</p><p>It’s why there are a lot of children living in adult bodies.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons people lose in life comes down to how they use boredom. For some of us, we’ve accidentally learned to harness boredom. We don’t talk about it because a lot of us don’t even realize we do it.</p><p>Here’s a completely different perspective on boredom that’ll upgrade your life.</p><h1>Boredom is a luxury</h1><p>A friend of mine lives in Africa.</p><p>His family is poor. He’s lived through famines. He’s someone I admire. When I asked him about boredom he laughed.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Only rich kids complain about boredom. In my village we have enough work to keep us busy for a decade. No time for boredom or you’ll starve.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In one way he’s making a joke, but in another way he’s bang on.</p><p>Being bored shows a lack of gratitude. There are people battling cancer who’d love to have zero worries in the world and experience boredom.</p><h1>Consumerism needs you to be a bored ape</h1><p>Society isn’t trying to get rid of boredom.</p><p>Why? Corporations need you to be bored so they can sell you magic pills to cure it – entertainment, sports, video games, mindless apps, etc.</p><p>Boredom has an even darker side.</p><p>I grew up around many drug addicts. One pattern I noticed is they all say they used drugs to try and cure their boredom. They wanted a thrill because they were bored.</p><p>A sniff of coke gave them a high. It also ruined their life. When I think about my own bad habits, they always get the best of me if I get too bored.</p><p>Boredom isn’t scary, but how we try to cure it is. It’s a slippery slope that can lead to an unescapable hell if you’re not careful.</p><h3>Romanticising boredom is a deadly cop out</h3><p>Boredom is a sign you’re living a life designed by someone else.</p><p>You took the traditional path. You listened too much to past, pre-internet generations. You took the default career path to nowhere to climb a corporate ladder leaning against the wrong wall.</p><p>There’s nothing worse than someone that brags about being bored. This same person lives for the weekends and they can’t stop thinking about their next escapism holiday because that’s honestly all they live for at this point in life.</p><p>Boredom is a big red blinking siren that’s trying to tell you to wake the f*ck up. And if you ignore the alert it’s the equivalent of hitting the snooze button on life for an eternity.</p><p>Boredom isn’t cool. It’s the highest form of mediocrity imaginable.</p><h1>The feeling of boredom is mislabeled</h1><p>The depth of experiences we can have as humans is vast.</p><p>We live in a world that has 100K pixel clarity. Life is fascinating if you actually choose to live it.</p><p>When people say they’re bored what they’re masking is a deep dissatisfaction for life itself. When what you do in life is so painfully useless, comfortable and lacks any sort of challenge, we wrongly call it boredom.</p><p>What we should call it is failure. Or a lack of goals. Or no passion.</p><h1>Your boredom holds your unrealized potential</h1><p>Netflix won’t make you feel better. It’s a sugar pill. It’s a fake placebo.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings.</em></p><p><em>You develop patience. Boredom no longer signals the need for distraction, but rather the need for new challenges to conquer.” – Robert Greene</em></p></blockquote><p>The cure for boredom is progress.</p><p>Not huge progress either. Just tiny 1%-better-each-day forms of progress. As an example, last week I felt a bit bored writing. Medium feels more stale than my daughter’s 2 week old sandwiches at the back of the couch.</p><p>So…I thought about how I could use this temporary boredom in my writing to harness it. The answer was lying right in front of my eyes. For the last 2 years I’ve wanted to start an Instagram profile.</p><p>This week I finally did.</p><p>Now, instead of boredom, I have a new excitement for writing. It’s a new challenge. A new way of writing.</p><p>It’s more visual. I don’t know anyone on Instagram. I have no idea how to use the platform. I don’t know if I’m doing it right. I’m a pig rolling in mud and sh*t, and it feels incredible.</p><p>Boredom unlocked my potential. The next level of the writing video game has now been discovered. The truth is you can play real video games and waste your life away… or you can treat real pursuits in life like a video game and level up.</p><p>In the process you’ll go from being a bored ape manipulated by news/politics and whatever culture war is going on, into becoming a beast in your field of obsession.</p><p>Boredom is trying to help your hidden potential get unleashed. Most people try to numb the feeling instead of harnessing it. Sad.</p><h1>Here’s how to hack your boredom to make it work in your favor</h1><p>Time to become an outlier. You might even join the top 1%.</p><h3>1. The best antidote to boredom in history</h3><p>If you’re bored just follow your curiosity.</p><pre><code>What are you curious about? What can you not stop thinking about? What’s a childhood activity you’ve given up?</code></pre><p>My answer to this is music. I was a musician until my mid-20s. I haven’t touched it for a decade. Last week my daughter got a toy drum kit on loan from the toy library. She handed me the drumsticks. I felt a wave of emotion.</p><p>I used to be one of the best drummers in the world (no exaggeration). Picking up those drumsticks again awakened a giant inside of me. Now I want to spend boring moments on the weekend showing my daughter the drums.</p><p>The cure to a boring life is right under your eyes.</p><h3>2. Play this game on hard mode</h3><p>Thinking of every pursuit in life as a video game is one of the best mental models.</p><p>Most people will play video games like Fortnite. A cooler video game to play in life is entrepreneurship. Starting a business makes everything in life better. Plus if it works to even a tiny degree, you end up with money.</p><p>Money is a resource that you can reinvest into your obsession to make it even better. I like the game of money because it’s tangible, whereas a lot of people play games to win fake prizes like points or participation trophies.</p><p>Play stupid games, win stupid prizes (as they say). Play games of obsession, like entrepreneurship, and become a different person you’ll be proud of.</p><h3>3. Stop letting yourself off the hook</h3><p>People let deadly boredom run their lives because they’re not hard enough on themselves.</p><p>A mediocre life is your responsibility. If the job sucks, it’s on you. If money is always a problem, it’s on you. If every friendship or romantic relationship turns into painful loneliness, it’s on you.</p><p>The good news is when you’re to blame you can solve it. It’s how you take back control. Try being a little harder on yourself.</p><p>More discipline. A series of daily habits that are non-negotiable. An exercise routine for more energy. Less junk food that clogs up your body and steals your energy.</p><p>As long as you label bad things “self-care” you’ll keep letting the devil win.</p><h3>4. Make this powerful choice</h3><p>When boredom strikes we have two options:</p><ul><li><p>Distraction</p></li><li><p>Building</p></li></ul><p>Option one leads you to become a destroyer. To be angry. To leave nasty comments. To talk smack about successful people. To engage in mindless activities like scrolling social media at 11 PM.</p><p>Option two leads to a beautiful life. One where you solve other people’s problems. Where you become an inspiration. Where you start a movement. Where you create something new you can be proud of.</p><p>Whenever you’re bored label the feeling with either “I’m going to embrace distraction” or “I’m going to build.” I recommend the latter.</p><h1>Final Thought</h1><p>It sounds cliche as f*ck, but what you do when boredom strikes or when you have some time before or after work can either make you or destroy you.</p><p>No one tells us this though. The distraction economy doesn’t want you to know this secret because then they can’t profit off you. I have nothing to lose so I’ll tell you.</p><p>Remember: The cure for boredom is progress.</p><p>Tell me which of these ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

Tears pouring down my face. A car nearly hit me at 75 miles an hour. It felt scary. It felt overwhelming.</p><p>Our 4-year relationship ended in an instant. We never spoke to each other again. The future marriage ceremony by the lake, lit on fire. The unborn baby we could have had, dead. Both of them.</p><p>It felt like the worst day of my life.</p><p>My identity was tied to her. We did everything together. She was my best friend. My only friend at the time, if I’m being honest. Everyone at work knew us as the two bankers who met and fell in love.</p><p>Now what would I tell them?</p><p>I’m not sure why we broke up. It was a feeling. I had dreams of wild success. She wanted to settle down. I wanted to stay in Melbourne and she wanted to go overseas every weekend (one trip we did was 48 hours in Asia … who does that?).</p><p>Jumping on planes was exhausting. She was doing it to escape. I didn’t want to escape. I wanted to double down on my writing and be near family.</p><p>Two different people, worlds apart.</p><h1>The post breakup phase is incredible</h1><p>Once the nail was in our relationship coffin everything changed.</p><p>I became a psychopath.</p><p>People didn’t recognize me. My true obsession for writing came alive. I launched a newsletter. I wrote more. I built an online business.</p><p>I stopped living for a partner and started living for me. I built a new life. One that didn’t have to meet another person’s standards. One where I could tell my bank boss to stick his job where the sun don’t shine.</p><p>When we were together I couldn’t quit banking. It was a couple’s activity. We caught the train together. We went to the same work events. We were always together which was 99% of the problem.</p><pre><code>Obsession forces you to seek solitude.</code></pre><p>You can’t do great things if you have a needy lover handcuffed to your leg begging you to “spend time with me, baby” every 5 seconds. Obsession changes how you do love.</p><h1>Breakups come in many outrageous forms</h1><p>The title of this story makes you think it’s all about love.</p><p>Breakups aren’t exclusive to a lover though. You can have a bad breakup with a boss, job, hobby, family member (even parent), or best friend.</p><p>I had a bad breakup with a boss in 2019. I worked with this guy in banking. He was cool. We ate steaks together. We swore a lot and sipped lattes every few days.</p><p>When I quit banking I got a new job. The role had no boss and they were hiring. I recommended this mofo for the job and he got it thanks to my endorsement. Shortly after I figured out he was the devil, worse than Hitler.</p><p>Then he fired me.</p><p>A friend no more. Traitor. It hurt bad. It took me many buckets of tears and 6 months to recover. The nice end to the story is he got fired, too, and ended up in a sh*tty job in the middle of butt-f*ck nowhere. So karma’s a b*tch, as they say.</p><p>This boss breakup changed my life.</p><p>I stopped trusting employers. I went harder on my side hustle. I got a new job but I was relentless. I said no to many boss requests. I had this carefree attitude that’d terrify most business leaders.</p><p>The bags under my eyes and the look in my pupils screamed “I’m here for 5 seconds then I’m gonna love ya and leave ya for my writing obsession.”</p><p>People I worked with knew my agenda. They didn’t care. Neither did I.</p><p>My side hustle was no longer a nice option. It was make-it-happen or death. No in-between. No piss-farting around. Pure relentlessness that’d rip your face off.</p><p>A breakup feels outrageous. And rage is what you need to get to the next level of life and do something you’ll be proud of.</p><h1>Orchestrate a breakup</h1><p>There’s something in your life you need to break up with.</p><p>A boss, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, a lover/spouse, bad parent, or 7-day-a-week job from hell. This story means nothing if you don’t take action.</p><p>I freaking dare you to break up with the thing you know is no good for you. I dare you to feel the fear and do it anyway. Obsession is found on the other side of breakups.</p><p>You need a catalyst to spark change. Change leads to transformation. And a good transformation needs obsession to give it rocket fuel to move forward.</p><p>When something feels like a horrible ending, it’s usually the seed of a new beginning. Only when we fall down hard and smack our face on the gutter, do we wake up and realize we’re living a groundhog day life that ends in boredom and regrets.</p><p>Wake up. Go have a break up.</p><p>Tell me if breakups have been good for you and why in the comments below.</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S.

Some say that makes me a loser.</p><p>I’ve always been that way and thought it was a bad thing. In my 20s everyone wanted to go out and party. I just wanted to sit in my bedroom and make electronic music. When I tried to take that music out to nightclubs as a DJ, I crashed and burned.</p><p>I now see loneliness differently, and you will too (shortly).</p><h1>The discomfort of isolation</h1><p>Loneliness is uncomfortable.</p><p>When I worked in banking I had to say no a lot. No to after-work drinks. No to weekends away with other bankers. No to going to the AFL football (our bank was the major sponsor).</p><p>Each no made me feel like crap. Like I was letting people down or something was wrong with me. But if I didn’t, then I would never have had the headspace to be a writer.</p><p>Modern life is slowly making us go insane.</p><p>We can’t switch off. We can’t escape. We live in constant FOMO. We have headphones on 24/7 that destroy our hearing and leave us with a high-pitched ringing in our ears, that contributes to the insanity. It’s why modern life is a horror film.</p><p>When you always have other people’s voices playing in your headphones, you drown out your own voice. You forget who you are. You can’t hear yourself think. Therefore, you can’t be creative or solve big problems.</p><p>So what are you left with? Crippling boredom that requires endless entertainment to numb the pain.</p><p>Loneliness starts out as uncomfortable because most of us don’t do it. Even when we are alone we have Netflix or our phone to talk with us. We’re truly never alone.</p><p>To unlock your inner genius you must embrace isolation for a long enough time.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“He moves fastest who moves alone.” ―&nbsp;Milton Friedman</p></div><h1>Lean into your dark side</h1><p>All of us have a dark side.</p><p>We unlock it when we’re alone. A recent example is Ben Affleck. He married Jennifer Lopez who he thought was the love of his life after decades of wanting one another.</p><p>Within two years they’re getting a divorce. This love affair started almost 20 years ago. Sources close to Ben say he has a dark side. He can never be fully present because he needs extended periods of solitude.</p><pre><code>It’s this alone time that has made him one of the greatest actors of our time.</code></pre><p>But his ex-wife JLO didn’t understand it. She wanted him to always be present. To always want to go away or be in the spotlight. On their honeymoon Ben and JLO had paparazzi around them all the time.</p><p>It led Ben to madness. So their marriage ended.</p><p>I can relate to this. Thankfully my wife knows I need solitude. She also likes the same alone time, so it works well for us.</p><p>In my banking days, I remember working out of a bank branch. All the other bankers would go home at 5 PM. I’d stay back. I’d finish my banking work at 5 PM and stick around to record podcasts with successful people. Or I’d stay there and write.</p><p>Most nights I wouldn’t leave before 9 or 10 PM. I stayed so late one night that I slept in my car. I was obsessed with this new life I’d found. I wanted to exit banking as quickly as possible, but knew only loneliness would get me there.</p><p>The other bankers used to make fun of me. They said I lived at the office. Bosses thought it was awesome. But no one knew I lived at the office to build my own thing, not do useless banking work like open bank accounts for customers.</p><p>Your dark side is where hidden potential is found. It comes out to play after hours.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Being alone is a power very few can handle” – Aaron Will</em></p></blockquote><h1>Success isn’t complicated (but everyone thinks it is)</h1><p>When I see complicated paths to success, I see bullsh*t.</p><p>Loneliness is a powerful tool to get anything you want in life. If you do it for 90 days everything will change in your life. Here’s the thing: <em>I can’t promise you what will change because it’s different for everyone.</em></p><p>What I know is loneliness forces you to rediscover who you are.</p><p>You won’t come out the other side of 90 days of deep solitude the same person. It’s exciting. It’s breathtaking. But it takes a level of discomfort most can’t handle.</p><p>The first few days are like being 48 hours into a water fast. This memory stands out as I’m 8 weeks away from another stint in hospital. Before I go under the knife, I’ll have to fast beforehand so it’s safe for the anesthetic.</p><p>As the hunger sets in so too will the darkness.</p><p>I’ve been down this road since 2015. First, I’ll wonder whether the cancer comes back. Then I’ll stress about the hospital because I hate needles and blood. This time I’ll stress harder because I have a 1 year old daughter. What if the hospital goes wrong?</p><p>But as wild as it sounds, I look forward to this darkness.</p><p>It’s deeply motivating. It interrupts my thought patterns and I come out the other side 10x more grateful than the average person who takes everything for granted.</p><p>The fasting will require solitude. The recovery in the hospital will require solitude, too. I wonder what the loneliness will teach me this time?</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Time alone isn’t lonely, it’s freedom” – OrangeBook</p></div><h1>90 days is all it takes to rediscover who you are</h1><p>My challenge to you is to embrace 90 days of loneliness.</p><p>Here’s what to do in the 90 days:</p><ul><li><p>Delete all your goals. Start again.</p></li><li><p>Start writing daily online so you can use it to think deeply.</p></li><li><p>Create a new vision for your life. Dream big.

I hit this milestone years ago from writing online. That means I get emails every day from people wanting to do the same.</p><p>Here’s my blanket response for how I made $1M from writing online.</p><h1>1. Write on social media</h1><p>Every day. Pick a topic you are crazy about. Reply to people’s comments. Have fun. Format your writing so it can be read on a phone. Ignore hateful comments.</p><h1>2. Don’t try to monetize on day one</h1><p>Focus on building a small audience first. Figure out what they want. Find their problems. When you find them, look for the pain.</p><p>Create a service to solve the problem. Promote it to your tiny audience. Make some money. Consider turning that service into a digital product to create more leverage.</p><h1>3. Have your life fall apart</h1><p>Wake up one morning and open your computer. Sip a cup of coffee. Smile at your crypto fortune. See all the Stripe emails for product sales. Think you’re a big shot. Consider ripping out a cigar and posting a selfie of you smoking it on social media.</p><p>For fun, check your digital wallet. Notice a withdrawal of more than $1M.</p><p>Fall to the floor. Nearly have a heart attack. Contact your best friend who works in crypto. Have him say “It’s gone, mate.” Have coffee with him later that day. Explain how you now know why a person can jump in front of a train.</p><p>Go home. Face your wife. Tell her you love her, then share the bad news. Watch the dreams of her first home go up in smoke with the look she gives. See nuclear mushroom clouds in her eyes. The woman you loved. Heartbroken. Speechless.</p><p>Go back to your office. Write. Make money online. Feel like sh*t. <em>This is the first ripple.</em></p><p>Because you now can’t afford a home, look around for a new house to rent. Go to the open for inspections. Have your rental applications turned down. Wait in line while hundreds of people try to rent the same property as you.</p><p>Be reminded that record-high property prices are the cause. No one can afford to buy so they rent. Be reminded how $1M was supposed to exclude you from this problem. Now you’ve gotta face it like everyone else.</p><p>Be humbled.</p><p>Eventually rent a new home under an airport flight path. Get woken up by helicopters flying overhead all day and night. Then, find out you’re going to be a parent. Be simultaneously joyful and terrified at the same time. Where will the baby sleep? How will the baby sleep?</p><p>Realize this is now the ripple effect at play and this is <em>the second ripple.</em></p><p>Rush your partner to the hospital. Baby is coming fast. Nurses everywhere. It’s all going to plan. Suddenly an alarm sounds. Doctors rush in. Your daughter’s heart rate is dropping. You could lose the baby. Blood everywhere. Needles. Gas.</p><p>Your daughter is born. She’s incredible. She pisses all over your new sweater and leaves a yellow stain. You smile. You kiss her. She can do no wrong. Perfection. Joy. <em>This is the third ripple.</em></p><p>Start looking for a new home (again). Go to house auctions in between writing and making money online. Lose every auction by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Be reminded again of the money that was stolen from you and what it could’ve done in this situation.</p><p>Keep trying. Try to have hope when it feels like there’s none. Finally find a house. Get excited. Make an early offer. Have the owner accept it. See the smile on your partner’s face. Move in. Feel on top of the world. Paint the walls. Get the grass redone. Install a big screen TV. Feel like you’ve made it.</p><p>One night, get woken up by loud music. Wonder what the hell is going on. Investigate. Discover you have a bad neighbor who believes they are above the law.</p><p>Get frustrated. Blow up. Go over and yell at them. Say things you wish you didn’t. Take them through the legal system. Sleepless nights. Waste a year of your life. Lose. Community organizations are above the law and have friends in local government. <em>This is the fourth ripple.</em></p><p>At the end of the legal battle you feel exhausted. You realize it’s taken a toll on your marriage. Your partner is not happy with you. You’ve let them down. You’ve spent too much time away from them dealing with this issue.</p><p>Make the difficult decision to get marriage counseling.</p><p>Feel like crap. Feel like a failed parent. Feel like you’ve let your daughter down. Enter the therapist’s office and feel like you’ve time-traveled back a decade, when you faced extreme mental illness. Remember the dark times. Have them haunt you.</p><p>Show up to couple’s therapy. See someone you know in the waiting area. Feel like even more of a loser. Tell no one. Keep it a secret. Pretend you’re okay. Act like a happy couple outside of therapy.</p><p>Wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares of divorce.</p><p>Imagine raising a child in a broken family in a broken 19070s home. Visualize the look on your kid’s face. Wake up the next day and commit to work on yourself. Try to find the source of the problem that led to therapy. Realize it’s you. <em>This is the fifth ripple.</em></p><p>Keep showing up to therapy. Listen. Notice the situation at home getting better. See the relief on your daughter’s face. Have the therapist make a strange comment. “Newly married couples with young children see me all the time. It’s normal. Getting therapy as a precaution is a sign of love, not a failing marriage.”</p><p>Feel relieved.</p><p>Late one afternoon you start writing a newsletter. You realize that everything in life is downstream of the ripple effect. One tiny event can trigger a series of other events. You can either make the ripples positive or negative. Making large sums of money has little to do with knowledge and more to do with what you’re putting out into the world each day.</p><p>You attract what you give. Create positive ripple effects for others and watch them reverberate back in your life.</p><h1>4.

Dinner parties are weird. Neighborly chats in the street feel off. “Going out with friends” is a struggle.</p><p>As soon as I talk it’s like I’m an alien. It’s why I still tell people I’m a banker because if I told them what I really did, which doesn’t fit into any defined career path, they’d be so confused they’d tune out.</p><p>Being an outcast is a daily struggle.</p><p>And it’s the kind of struggle we should embrace. When I talk about being an outcast some people get confused. They think I’m talking about being a weirdo or wearing rainbow-colored pants to the supermarket sometimes. Nope.</p><p>An outcast is someone who doesn’t fit in. They’re outspoken. And most of all, they hate the mainstream narrative and avoid it like a bat virus plague.</p><p>Here’s why being an outcast is a superpower that you must embrace.</p><h1>“Fitting in” has the worst rewards in history</h1><p>When you try to fit in you become someone you’re not.</p><p>That means you’re a Hollywood actor jumping through circus hoops trying to do a strip dance for an audience of strangers. Fitting in means not being yourself, and it’s the secret goal of most people.</p><p>If you break down people’s fears, like I have through my fearless writer challenge, you realize the average person doesn’t want to rock the boat or speak out of turn.</p><p>They’re worried they’ll be canceled or face a moment of public embarrassment, where their execution is televised for the world to see.</p><p>Outcasts know this powerful truth: <strong>nobody gives a sh*t.</strong></p><p>Nobody gives a sh*t about your career.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about if you’re poor.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about whether you’re happy.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about what you write online.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about whatever personal tragedy you’re facing.</p><p>All the average person gives a sh*t about is themselves.</p><p>We’re now all drowning in so many day-to-day problems we don’t have mental bandwidth to deal with anyone else’s. 24/7 news cycles, phone notifications, a full-time career, a lifetime of daily emails to open and delete, a to-do list a mile long.</p><p>The modern human is busier than ever so they don’t have time to give a damn about you. And that’s the best news you will hear for the rest of this decade.</p><h3>If you fit in you’re replaceable.</h3><p>Fitting in means copying others.</p><p>It means you walk and talk the same. It means you wear a penguin suit to work so you look like all the other penguins hoping for a big annual bonus and a juicy promotion.</p><p>It means you watch Marvel superhero movies and consume the same Netflix tv series that every other monkey in a clown suit is drowning themselves in so they can numb the pain of their normal life into next year.</p><ul><li><p>Fitting in means 6-figures of debt for a useless college degree.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means living next to the Joneses in the suburbs and trying to one-up them every year with a house renovation or new car.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means choosing a traditional career path, where your creativity and imagination is suppressed so hard you start to internally combust and sh*t out your mouth.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means taking on a home loan to buy a house you can’t afford that you’ll be paying off for the rest of your life. The recurring debt payments mean you can’t take lots of time off work. You must be heavily money-focused for the rest of your life. Always keeping score.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means being less than you can be so you don’t shine too bright.</p></li></ul><p>This is a nightmare way to live that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy, Matt (screw you if you’re reading, matey, you piece of cr*p).</p><pre><code>The traditional path is the path to nowhere.</code></pre><p>In a world of massive technological change, artificial intelligence that leads to infinite intelligence, low cost or even $0 electricity thanks to nuclear energy, and human labor no longer needed because of robots… doing what humans always did is the path to 1930s depression-like poverty and mental illness.</p><p>If you follow the conventional path you’re replaceable.</p><p>If you follow your curiosity anything is possible.</p><h1>Being an outcast creates loneliness which is a superpower</h1><p>Sometimes it’s lonely for me to be an outcast.</p><p>I feel like I don’t belong. But more and more I’m realizing solitude is a powerful habit. When you’re alone you can think deeply. My best creative work comes from periods of loneliness. Time alone lets me shut out the noise and focus.</p><p>The flow states that follow we’ll knock most people to the floor.</p><p>3 years of work in a week is no joke when you embrace solitude and let it lead to flow states. Maybe the real problem is that humans need to spend too much time socializing so they feel like they belong to something.</p><p>In the process, they don’t have enough time to achieve their big goals.</p><p>Show me someone who’s okay to be lonely, and I’ll show you an outcast who will go on to do great things and change the world.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It’s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone.” — Robin Williams</p></div><h1>Common sense is daylight robbery for your future</h1><p>Screw being normal.</p><p>Normal people follow the mainstream narrative. They argue over politics like it’s going to save their lives. Red versus Blue thinking in America is the worst. What if Red and Blue are both part of the same side?</p><p>Election promises are bullsh*t. When you’ve only got the top job for 4 years you’ll say anything. If you deliver on none of your promises there are no consequences.</p><blockquote><p>If a guy who’s in his 80s and can hardly string together two words is in charge of the greatest nation on the planet, what does that say?</p></blockquote><p>He’s not running anything. Someone is but it’s not Joe, Kamala, or Orange Man.</p><p>I don’t believe in conspiracy theories, so my best guess is the richest Americans run the U.S. and they use their money to manipulate congress through lobbying. This is why the mainstream narrative is a clown show.</p><p>All it does is outsource your control to a 3rd party where you have no control. People tell outcasts like me to follow common sense.</p><p>That means taking pharmaceutical pills, murdering loads of animals so I can eat, watching news designed to make me mad, getting into debt through toxic consumerism behaviour, and watching my savings erode to nothing thanks to underreported inflation and money printing.</p><p>Common sense is insanity.</p><p>Outcasts question everything. They even question the fact-checkers themselves.</p><h1>Being an outcast is a deep human experience that bends reality</h1><p>I never fit in at school.</p><p>There were three groups: Aussies, Europeans (Greeks/Italians), and Chinese. The Aussies rejected me because I didn’t care about driving fast muscle cars or throwing a shrimp on the barbie. No thanks, mate.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg" width="234" height="359.775" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:984,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:234,&quot;bytes&quot;:124382,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Image credit: Wikipedia Creative Commons (1984 Paul Hogan ad for Australia)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>I tried to fit in with the Europeans but their parents told them not to hang around Aussies like me.</p><p>Because of their racism, within 6 months of being in high school, my 3 best Italian friends would no longer speak to me. They ran away whenever I came near them. I tried with the Chinese, too, but I couldn’t speak their language so they looked at me and smiled.</p><p>By the end of high school, I decided university wasn’t for me.</p><p>My school didn’t know what to do with me. They told me to leave so I did. I ended up studying sound engineering with no prior experience. I had to lie about my age to get in at 16 years old when I should have been 18 and had a high school diploma.</p><p>In adult life, I decided to marry my wife who is from China. Aussies didn’t get it. They made fun of me. <strong>One Medium dot com article ridiculed me and said I was a s*xpat.</strong></p><p>I’d never heard this word before.</p><p>Nowadays, when I go to pick up my daughter from daycare I get all sorts of strange looks. Only mothers pick up their kids at our daycare. The dads are all at work. When I take my daughter swimming I’m the only dad. The other parents are all mothers.</p><p>They all look at me with this strange facial expression that says: “why isn’t he at an office job providing for his family?”</p><p>Office jobs made me depressed. That’s why. And gender-allocated roles are silly.</p><p>When I was 6 years old my two best friends were Sri Lankan. We played cricket and ate curry every day. As a teenager many of my friends were Muslim.</p><p>I fasted with them during Ramadan. I even went to the mosque with them. Now, in my 30s, I go to Jewish Passover every year with friends and even read ancient passages.</p><p>When you don’t fit in and embrace other cultures your human experience is way more nuanced. You eat food from different parts of the world. You speak different languages. You go places others are afraid to go.</p><p>Black and white thinking and being stuck in a bubble is worse than being an outcast.</p><p>The full human experience is understanding all humans, not just the rednecks in your own backyard.</p><h1>See things differently and tell it as it is</h1><p>I don’t sugarcoat anything.</p><p>I learned this from my former buddha boss, who’s one of the most interesting outcasts I’ve ever come across. He tells it how it is.</p><p>If the IT systems at the bank are blowing up, he tells you. “It’s bad. Very bad.” His counterparts would try to make it sound like everything was fine which led to more devastation. Not buddha boss man.</p><pre><code>An outcast sees things differently which is why they’re often isolated or treated badly.</code></pre><p>I find hanging around outcasts useful because of this. I want to know what other viewpoints exist on a topic. If everyone is looking at an issue from the front, I like to talk to an outcast and get the upside-down view.</p><p>Growth only happens when we’re forced to stretch ourselves to the point of discomfort.</p><h1>The world is moving towards a “category of one”</h1><p>There’s a logical reason why more of us feel like outcasts.</p><p>I often say to writers “you are the niche.” Writer Mike Goitein said to me in a chat “we are all a category of one.”</p><p>As more of us begin to embrace social media, we no longer fit inside of neat boxes anymore. None of us are single-topic humans. We’re not single-industry humans either. The trend of being a one-person business is catching on.</p><p>When you go from believing you’re an employee with a boss, to believing you’re a one-person with one customer (an employer) or multiple clients, your thinking starts to shift. The limitations the world wants to put on you in the form of niches, job titles, and labels don’t make sense anymore.</p><p>The more of us that go through this transformation, the more outcasts we will have.</p><h1>Being an outcast is the highest form of compliment in existence</h1><p>Let’s finish here.</p><p>Being an outcast is a massive compliment. Embrace it. It means you’re not being brainwashed. Instead, you’re programming your own mind.

I can’t explain how much I miss you and how often I think about you. I would say at least 50 times a day. </p><p>If I could push pause and freeze my life for a moment it would be with you in the hammock listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/yYcyacLRPNs?si=q8MeKyqgxtdO86kE&amp;t=33">this song</a> on our last day together. Your body had given up but you were so warm, so cosy and so happy. I was hiding the tears in my eyes. Me and you had known for a while this moment was coming and we hadn’t wasted a second. </p><p>You really taught me how to live life in the 6 months I knew you Tina and you left a huge impact not just on me but on the world. </p><p>You might no longer be here physically Tina but I wanted to tell you how you are still everywhere…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png" width="1348" height="770" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:770,&quot;width&quot;:1348,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2536629,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>You Made Me A Better Person</h3><p>You won’t believe how hard things got after you passed Tina. I’m sure they are all sitting beside you playing now but a week after you I also lost Snoop. A couple of months later Derek and Jumbo also left this world. It was one of the hardest few months in my life. The 4 of you were such wonderful dogs and the house was very quiet. I hope you are sharing tennis balls with the boys and all keeping each other safe. </p><p>What got me through that time and other tough moments was one thing Tina. It was thinking about you. Any challenge I’ve faced this past year (there have been many) I just think of your face and your soft nature. </p><p>I think my own sobriety, depression and anxiety was already in control when I met you but you cemented the recovery. When I whispered in your ear a year ago that I would never let you or all the other dogs down it was an unbreakable promise.

I’m sitting here writing beside <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-cy3bQvnEO/">Bowie and her 6 puppies</a> and I can’t help but think what a great mum you’d have been if you were given the chance. </p><p>You won’t believe it Tina but we’ve managed to sterilise <a href="https://www.happydoggo.com/our-work">20,000 dogs since the day you passed</a>. We do it with 9 wonderful partners in 3 countries. It’s a big number to think about Tina but we estimate that might have stopped 200,000+ dogs being born into suffering like you. </p><p>It wouldn’t be right to for me and you to take credit for it Tina as there are SO SO many people involved and so much money to raise and logistics to plan.

Similarly, the co-founders of <strong>Snapchat</strong> had a bitter legal battle that resulted in one co-founder being ousted, leading to a costly settlement.</p><p>So before you dive into building your business, there’s one crucial step you can’t overlook—a co-founder agreement. After all, you’ll probably be spending more time with them than anyone else (yes, even your family or life partner).</p><p>A co-founder agreement can prevent disputes by setting clear expectations from day one. No matter how aligned you seem at the beginning, as your business grows, challenges can surface: different goals, disagreements over equity, or even legal issues. These conflicts, if not addressed early, could tear apart everything you’ve built.</p><p>A good co-founder agreement sets the groundwork for a strong partnership by clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and how major decisions will be made. By putting these crucial details in writing, you not only avoid misunderstandings but also protect your company’s future.</p><p>Some fundamental questions need answers upfront to keep everyone on the same page. Such as - are you both aiming for rapid growth or slow, steady scaling? Will you prioritize profits or social impact?</p><p>Below, we’ll show you how to create a co-founder agreement that safeguards your startup from unexpected risks down the road, gives clarity on the direction of the business, and outlines your shared vision and long-term goals, helping avoid future conflicts.</p><div><hr></div><h2>1. Key Components of a Co-Founder Agreement</h2><p>Here are the <strong>key components</strong> that every co-founder agreement should include:</p><h3>Roles, Responsibilities &amp; Working Styles</h3><p>Defining clear roles is essential to avoid confusion. Each co-founder should have a role that leverages their strengths—whether one is handling product development or another is in charge of sales. It’s not just about responsibilities, though; working styles should also align. For example:</p><ul><li><p>How do you make decisions? Is one co-founder a fast decision-maker while the other prefers more thorough deliberation?</p></li><li><p>How do you balance differing approaches to problem-solving?</p></li></ul><p>By addressing these factors early, you create a smoother workflow and avoid potential conflicts.</p><h3>Equity &amp; Vesting</h3><p>Equity can make or break co-founder relationships. A good agreement outlines how equity is split, considering each co-founder’s contributions—be it time, capital, or resources. Vesting schedules, often a four-year period with a one-year cliff, help ensure co-founders stay committed to the company's long-term success. This also ensures no one leaves with a disproportionate amount of equity if they exit early.</p><h3>Decision-Making &amp; Dispute Resolution</h3><p>Clear decision-making rules are essential. The agreement should address how major decisions are made—through voting rights or veto powers, for instance. In the case of a tie or deadlock, having a resolution plan, like a designated final decision-maker, can save time and conflict. If disputes arise, arbitration or other conflict resolution mechanisms, such as mediation, can prevent costly legal battles.</p><h3>Capital Contributions &amp; Compensation</h3><p>How much money, resources, or time is each co-founder investing? These contributions should be clearly defined and linked to equity and compensation. For example, one co-founder might contribute cash, while the other contributes a unique skill set or intellectual property. A plan should be in place to address additional funding needs down the line.</p><p>Defining these contributions early avoids financial disagreements and ensures fairness.</p><h3>Salaries, Profit Sharing &amp; Compensation</h3><p>Early-stage startups often operate on limited funds, meaning co-founders may not draw significant salaries right away. However, as the company grows, compensation should evolve. Address short-term salary expectations and long-term profit-sharing strategies to ensure each co-founder feels fairly compensated. This prevents financial strain and resentment later.</p><p>By covering these essential elements, your co-founder agreement will protect your business and help foster a collaborative, transparent, and aligned partnership from the start.</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. Advanced Legal Considerations in a Co-Founder’s Agreement</h2><p>When drafting a co-founder agreement, it’s vital to include <strong>advanced legal considerations</strong> to protect your business’s intellectual property and ensure legal compliance. Overlooking these details can lead to costly disputes down the road.</p><h3>Intellectual Property (IP)</h3><p>Clarifying ownership of intellectual property (IP) such as <strong>service marks</strong>, <strong>trademarks</strong>, and any proprietary technologies is crucial. IP disputes are common among startups—<strong>29%</strong> of startups that fail cite legal challenges as a significant factor.</p><p>The agreement should detail:</p><ul><li><p>Who owns the IP developed during the startup’s operations?</p></li><li><p>How will IP be handled if a co-founder leaves?</p></li><li><p>Confidentiality and non-compete clauses should be included to safeguard business secrets.</p></li></ul><p>Ensure the agreement includes a <strong>non-disclosure agreement (NDA)</strong> to protect sensitive information, preventing co-founders from using company secrets if they leave.</p><h3>Tax Considerations</h3><p>Tax liabilities can vary depending on the type of business structure and the location of your startup. Seek legal advice early on, especially for co-founder agreements involving multiple regions, as tax laws differ significantly across jurisdictions. Setting clear guidelines on how taxes will be managed can prevent surprises and legal penalties.</p><h3>Seek Legal Advice</h3><p>Startups often underestimate the complexity of their agreements. Seeking professional legal advice ensures that all complex matters—like <strong>dispute resolution</strong>, IP ownership, and tax obligations—are adequately covered. Investing in legal counsel now could save you millions later by avoiding lawsuits and IP theft.</p><div><hr></div><h2>3. Termination, Exit, and Dissolution Clauses</h2><p>When building a startup, planning for the future is essential, even if it means preparing for potential exits. A well-drafted co-founder agreement should include <strong>termination, exit, and dissolution clauses</strong> to manage how co-founders can leave and what happens to their equity and intellectual property (IP).</p><h3>Founder Exits</h3><p>Whether voluntary or involuntary, clear procedures need to be outlined for handling founder exits. This includes the notice period, the terms for the return of unvested shares, and any buyout agreements for remaining equity. For instance:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Voluntary Exit</strong>: A co-founder who leaves the company can either retain vested shares or agree to a buyout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Involuntary Exit</strong>: For cases like misconduct, the agreement should allow for the retrieval of both vested and unvested shares.</p></li></ul><h3>Dissolution</h3><p>If the business closes, the agreement must outline how remaining assets, including shares and IP, will be distributed. Planning for dissolution avoids conflicts, ensuring a fair and orderly wind-up of the business. This includes deciding how patents, trademarks, and proprietary technology will be handled if the company no longer exists.</p><p>Having these clauses in place ensures a smooth transition and protects the company from legal battles that could derail its future.</p><div><hr></div><h2>4. How to Draft a Co-Founder Agreement</h2><p>Now that we’ve discussed the details of why you need a co-founder’s agreement and the various nuts and bolts associated with it, let’s give you a clear roadmap to help you create one.</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Templates</h3><p>Using pre-made templates is a great way to jumpstart the drafting process. Several resources, like <strong><a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/founders-agreement-template/">PandaDoc</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://legaltemplates.net/">LegalTemplates.net</a></strong>, offer free co-founder agreement templates that cover essential aspects like equity, vesting schedules, and decision-making processes. (You can also find more templates on <strong><a href="https://signaturely.com/contracts/founders-agreement-template/">Signaturely</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.wonder.legal/modele/founders-agreement">Wonder.Legal</a></strong>)</p><p>Begin by downloading one of these templates, which you can later customize to fit your business’s unique needs. Keep in mind, templates are only a starting point and may not cover all specific scenarios.</p><h3>Step 2: Legal Review</h3><p>Once you’ve tailored the template to your business, it’s essential to get a legal review. This step ensures that any complex legalities—like intellectual property ownership or tax obligations—are properly addressed. A lawyer can help spot gaps and ensure the agreement complies with regional laws.</p><h3>Step 3: Align Working Styles and Goals</h3><p>Before formalizing the agreement, it’s important to align your working styles and business goals. Engage in real-world exercises, like working on a project together, to observe how you and your co-founder handle decision-making and conflict. This step is key in uncovering potential friction points early on, helping to tailor the agreement to reflect each person’s strengths and expectations.</p><p>By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive co-founder agreement that not only protects your business but also fosters a collaborative partnership.</p><div><hr></div><h2>5. The Co-Founder Marriage</h2><p>Building a business with a co-founder is exciting, but it’s not without challenges. Having those tough conversations early—about roles, equity, decision-making, and vision—might feel uncomfortable, but they’re necessary. You wouldn’t jump into a long-term relationship without discussing expectations, right? The same goes for starting a business.</p><p>Think of your co-founder as a partner—you’ll spend more time with them than anyone else, at least in the early days. So, getting everything in writing with a solid agreement will save you from future headaches.</p><p>The reality is that the more aligned you are on the big stuff now, the easier it’ll be to face challenges later. Don’t consider a co-founder agreement another formality; it’s your blueprint for success. It clarifies everything so you can focus on what really matters—building something amazing together. So, take the time, get it right, and protect both your business and your partnership from the start.</p><div><hr></div><h2>6.

Ilgą laiką taip darau. Tačiau šį kartą prie manęs priėjo kasininkė ir paklausė:</p><p>– Kodėl neįmušėte plastikinio maišelio?<br>– Čia žinokit aš savo iš namų atsinešiau.<br>– Tikrai?<br>– Taip tikrai, galit patikrinti dar smirda levandų oro gaivikliu. Aš visus maišelius taip pasižymiu, – čia vienas iš retų atvejų, kai sugebėjau atsikirsti. Nes tokiuose situacijose dažniausiai būna “žadėjau sakyti”. Tai yra tyliu kaip liurbis, tada po trijų dienų permąstymo sugalvoju, ką būčiau sakęs. Ir kai draugams pasakoju istorija, žinoma, ten būna tas per tris dienas išmąstytas atsikirtimas.</p><p></p><p>Mane paleido. Iš pradžių galvojau, kad kasininkė durna. Juk galėjo peržiūrėti filmuotą medžiagą ir mane pagauti. Bet grįžęs namo supratau, kad čia kasininkė nėra durna. Ją sistema pasiuntė manęs įspėti. </p><p>Esu girdėjęs, kad anksčiau įspėjimas būdavo, kad grįžęs namie klozete rasdavai cigaretės biką, nors bute niekas nerūko. Tipo, saugumas tave stebi, neuždavinėk keistų klausimų. Dabar viskas per plastikinį maišelį.</p><p>Man plastikinis maišelis yra galimybė kažką palikti po savęs. Mano tekstai ir mano humoras tikrai nepergyvens pievoje išmesto plastikinio maišelio. Negaliu sukurti šedevro, užtat galiu palikti plastikinį maišelį. Pastarasis šimtmečius šnarės pievoje. Kaip skulptūra. Kaip menas.</p><p>JIE žino, kaip man svarbu plastikiniai maišeliai, todėl ir nusprendė būtent taip pašiurpinti.</p><p>Žinoma, buvo momentas kuomet galvojau, kad man su galva negerai ir aš čia viską išsigalvoju. Bet atidžiau apžiūrėjus savo butą. Jame viskas pakeista identiškais baldais. Net sienos perdažytos identiška spalva. Prieš kelias dienas buvo atėjęs draugas su nauju fotoaparatu. Labai aukštos kokybės. Atsidariau nuotrauką ir sulyginau virtuvės sieną su esama ir nuotraukoje. Nepatikėsite – viskas identiškai, kiekvienas įbrėžimas atitaikytas. Kam JIEMS taip daryt? Kada JIE spėjo? Kiek JIEMS tai kainavo?</p><p>O aš po tiltu pasakiau, tik tai ką perskaičiau vienoje knygoje: Yra tiesioginė priklausomybė tarp to kiek parduodama ledų ir to kiek žmonių nuskęsta ežeruose ir jūrose. Vos tik Lietuvoje pradeda kilti valgomųjų ledų pardavimai, lyg iš gausybės rago pasipila žmonių skendimai. </p><p>Ledų industrijai tai yra skaudi tiesa, kurią jie bando nuslėpti. Aš tik noriu priminti Valdo Skymantevičiaus dingimo istoriją. Nėra žinoma, nei kas, nei kaip. Tačiau užtenka pagalvoti savo galva. </p><p>Valdas turėjo startupą. Jis su savo komanda buvo pastebėjęs, kad labai daug intravertų perka ledų vien tam, kad jeigu pakeliui sutiktų pažįstamų, jiems galėtų atsakyti:</p><p>– Soriukas, turiu varyt, nes tirpsta ledai.</p><p>Nors tų ledų intravertai net nevalgydavo. Valdas čia pamatė nišą ir sukūrė išlankstomą dėžutę, kuri atrodo kaip ledų pakuotė. Intravertai, nusipirkę tokią lengvai išlankstomą dėžutę, visuomet reikalui esant gali turėti pretekstą išvengti nepatogaus, kad ir labai mažo pokalbio. Jis ten turėjo labai skambų šūkį:</p><p>“Kam pirkti ledus ir juos išmesti kai gali nusipirkti dėžutę, ją patogiai nešiotis, o reikalui esant išsilankstyti”.</p><p>Jeigu su Valdu susidorojo dėl tokio menko startupo. Kodėl su manimi neturėtų susidoroti? Ypač po to, kai tokią skaudžia tiesą pasakiau prieš septynių žmonių minią. Nemaloniausia šioje istorijoje, kad visi tie septyni žmonės yra mano šeimos nariai. Vadinasi, negailestingai ledų industrijai, dirba kažkas iš mano šeimos. Tai tarsi dūris peiliu į nugarą.</p><p>Bet žinote, mylimi skaitytojai ir skaitytojos, man nebaisūs nei nykštukai, nei tirpukai, nei kar kar ar tuo labiau karališki. Man svarbu yra tiesa ir aš ją jums toliau skleisiu.

But if the boss says you need to complete a task, stay back or work weekends, can you say no? Nope. You think you can but you can’t.</p><p>Say no a few times and you’ll mysteriously get laid off. Or forced out. Go on, try it. I f*cking dare you. I did.</p><p>The truth is jobs are modern slavery.</p><p>The good news is the economy is changing. Instead of always-there-to-work we’re moving to just-in-time-workers.</p><p>This shift is creating the massive trend of one-person businesses – consultants, freelancers, coaches, contractors, etc. Instead of one employer you have multiple. Each employer is a customer of your business.</p><p>In my experience working as both an employee and as a one-person business, I’ve learned one thing:</p><p>You can’t count on a boss or employer anymore.</p><h1>Building a business gives you real freedom</h1><p>The employee life made me think I was free.</p><p>But my calendar was full of meetings that I had to attend. When you get into business you <em>actually</em> control your calendar. Like, for real. Appointments only exist if you let them.</p><p>This is a subtle difference but it let’s you design your life how you want.</p><p>Yes, starting a business is scary. What’s ya point? You can lean into the uncomfortable task of starting a business or hide from it and work for someone else’s. But you can’t hide forever. One day regrets will bite you on the butt.</p><p>As my friend Dan Go said:</p><blockquote><p>It was worth trading my personal training job for one year of building an online empire on X to live a lifetime of freedom and make 7-figures a year.</p></blockquote><p>Starting a business is hard but not being free is, too. Choose your hard. Short-term pain or forever pain that’s irreversible.</p><h1>Starting a business lets you chase your f*cking obsession</h1><p>Starting a business is the same as going to the gym every day, lying down on the bench press, and lifting the most weight you can. It hurts but it gets your juices flowing. And you get the post-workout feel-good endorphins.</p><p>What isn’t obvious is business is just a vehicle for obsession.</p><p>You must be obsessed to start a business and keep going long enough to get traction. That’s why businesses built solely for money, or ones that are tied to a hobby/passion/interest fail miserably and destroy people.</p><p>Business is intense. Obsession is the only path to give you the right intensity.</p><p>Everyone should chase obsession at least once in their lives. One year of business obsession can change your life forever.</p><p>Starting a business is building your own world. You create the laws. You set the mission. It becomes a movement that is all-consuming and draws people in like a tornado they can’t escape.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>A pattern I've noticed in successful people:</p><p>They’re obsessed.</p></div><h1>Answer to no one (forever)</h1><p>Being told what to do is annoying.</p><p>My last boss was like a fly on my back. He kept buzzing up my nose every few seconds. The guy couldn’t relax. My work email was full of other people’s commitments and priorities. But all I wanted to do was write online.</p><p>What changed my life was when I quit bosses forever.</p><p>None of them knew what was best when it came to business, anyway. And they sure as hell didn’t know what was best for me and my young family.</p><p>Some people are so brainwashed they think their employer can tell them not to post stuff on social media. So they have their free speech right taken away.</p><p>It’s only when you talk with a lawyer and they laugh loudly that you realize a so-called “social media policy” is what we call in Australia “Trying sh*t on to see if it sticks.”</p><p>Classic example: my second-last bank employer said if I quit, I couldn’t work in banking again for 5 years. LOL. Okay Mr Bank. Sure.</p><p>Soon as I quit I got another job in banking THE NEXT DAY. They didn’t sue me. And if they did they would lose. Because, you know, we’re free to leave employers whenever.</p><pre><code>The rules aren’t the rules.</code></pre><p>They are often guidelines that the sheep follow who never question anything. I question every freaking thing, and most of the time what I find is “policies” are bulsh*t and they’re created by controlling morons.</p><p>Stop answering to other people. Exit the corporate daycare and leave the toddlers to fight over the next product update that’ll disappoint the market like it always does.</p><p>Being told what to do is a virus. It’s better to build a business and figure out what you want to do in life, without all the political games and permission slips.</p><h1>Worst thing that happens is it fails. Best thing is you make a living.</h1><p>What are you so afraid of?</p><p>If everything I’ve said is wrong and I get you fired because you share a puppy photo from the weekend on your LinkedIn, <em>what’s the worst that can happen?</em></p><p>People hold onto jobs like they hold onto 3 year old toddlers who want to walk up and pat a crocodile.</p><p>You can always get another job. </p><p>The world is overflowing with jobs. They’re out of fashion. They’re time has expired. The lack of freedom is making them the worst option.</p><p>If you start a business and it fails you go right back to a job. No worries, mate. But consider the other side. If it works then you make a living by yourself without the nanny police and silly HR policies.</p><p>There’s literally no downside.</p><p>Plus, starting a business will teach you more than a degree or endless online courses ever will. The wisdom is in the action. It’s in taking a calculated risk. It’s in backing yourself. It’s in running a business, not being a faceless line item in someone else’s.</p><h1>Just start a business</h1><p>Start a business because it’s fun.

It’s really about how a grey market psychedelic culture is taking off in California, even though these substances are not even decriminalized (yet). People are wilding out—selling shrooms online, holding psychedelic events out in the open, and even inviting journalists like me to write about them. There’s a veneer of legitimacy around all of these happenings; the shroom gummies at the yoga class looked like they belonged on a shelf in Erewhon. But what are the real implications and risks? I talked to underground entrepreneurs, psychedelic therapists, business consultants, and even an ethicist to get to the bottom of it. </p><p>Since the article is currently behind the LAT paywall, I’m sharing a short excerpt with ya’ll below. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png" width="1456" height="1885" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1885,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1569766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Also, next Monday,  I will be in conversation with <em>New Yorker</em> writer Emily Witt at Skylight bookstore in LA.

In the lobby, shelves displayed serums, candles and natural deodorants next to black boxes filled with magic mushroom gummies. A greeter ushered attendees into a dark windowless room with yoga mats on the carpeted floor, asking each person: “Would you like some mushroom tea?”</p><p>They were there for a yoga class hosted by Personalized Wellbeing, a Los Angeles-based company that provides a range of wellness-based services that support psychedelic experiences. The mushrooms were provided by Psilouette, a brand under the Personalized Wellbeing umbrella with a line of gummies, teas and cacao butter squares containing magic mushrooms. Psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, remains illegal federally and in the state of California. But in Los Angeles’ growing illicit market, Personalized Wellbeing and Psilouette are notable for their sleek branding and brazenness. Tickets to the mushrooms-enhanced yoga class were offered online for <a href="https://archive.is/o/P8TEi/https://personalizedwellbeing.org/collections/microdose-gummies-1/products/assisted-movement-meditation-with-dr-bianca-hur-psyd">$100 per person</a>, and a publicist for the company invited journalists to cover the event, two of whom were in attendance.</p><p>“I thought I was the only person who likes doing drugs while doing yoga, but it’s a <em>thing</em>,” joked Personal Wellbeing founder Derek Chase, who walked around the studio bare-chested with a tumble of blond hair dusting his shoulders. Once everyone was at their mats, staff members began distributing gummies to guests.</p><p>The class is part of an occasional series that Personalized Wellbeing offers to the 25,000 people on its email list, according to Chase. Although the class is private, the company sells mushroom gummies and other products on the Psilouette website, and claims to ship worldwide. They’re not alone in the wellness community, as substances like psilocybin and LSD become increasingly mainstream, destigmatized and easier to access, wellness enthusiasts have begun incorporating them into their self-care routines.</p><blockquote><p><em>“I thought I was the only person who likes doing drugs while doing yoga, but it’s a thing.”</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>— Derek Chase, founder of Personalized Wellbeing</strong></p><p>Personalized Wellbeing’s shroom yoga class is part of a broader trend of psychedelic-enhanced experiences catering to the curious and health-conscious; in Colorado, where psilocybin has been decriminalized at the state level, wellness center 4 Winds Farm offers psychedelic retreats for women. In the 2020 Netflix docu-series “The Goop Lab,” staffers from Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness company went on a retreat in Jamaica to eat, pray and drink mushroom tea. It’s not uncommon to see the cryptic phrase “gummy optional” when signing up for a <a href="https://archive.is/o/P8TEi/https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/list/best-soundbaths-los-angeles">sound bath</a> in certain parts of Los Angeles.</p><p>“We’re going to start to see [similar] events sprout up because the results are really effective,” said Chase in a phone call before Personalized Wellbeing’s yoga class. “I think people are losing the fear [of psychedelics] and are looking for ways to experience the products.”</p><p>But are companies like Personalized Wellbeing putting themselves and their customers at risk by acting as if magic mushrooms are legal? In recent years, California lawmakers’ attempts to legalize psychedelics have <a href="https://archive.is/o/P8TEi/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-16/psychedelics-law-fails-again">repeatedly failed</a>. In August, the FDA also rejected Lykos Therapeutics’ proposal to legalize MDMA-assisted therapy, citing concerns over clinical trial designs. The decision sent shock waves through the psychedelic industry, suggesting substances might not be legalized for the masses as soon as a growing number of companies and investors in the space would like.</p><p>Nevertheless, consumer demand for psychedelic experiences remains, and players in an illegal market who were once cautiously discreet are becoming bolder… </p><div><hr></div><h2>📝 TRIP REPORT</h2><p>Behind an unmarked door on Sunset Boulevard in Echo Park, a secret is hidden in plain sight. Peering through frosted glass behind a pulled-down grate, you might spot two handsome doctors playing Steve Roach’s ambient electronica as they inject ketamine into people’s arms. <a href="https://www.losangelescommunityketamineclinic.com/">Los Angeles Community Ketamine Clinic</a> pops up once a month in an acupuncture studio, and relies entirely on word-of-mouth. While most luxury clinics cost thousands of dollars, LACKC does group sessions for up to three people at a time, which allows them to offer their services for around $200 a pop. </p><p>“It’s sort of an anarchist art project,” said co-founder Matt Baldwin, a psychedelic therapist who used to play in punk bands and has released <a href="https://leavingrecords.com/show-invisibles-or-how-to-make-a-tape-loop">squiggly tape machine</a> music on Leaving Records. When he learned that I was a music journalist, Matt even stopped by my apartment to drop off a zine he’d made about music for psychedelic therapy. </p><p>In addition to making ketamine therapy more affordable, providing an actually-good psychedelic soundtrack is the emphasis of LACKC, and both Matt and his business partner Mark Shortt are adamant that music itself is the medicine—the psychedelics just open you up to it. </p><p>My previous experiences with ketamine therapy have been <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/at-home-ketamine/">underwhelming</a>, and there was one journey in particular that I almost ended early because the New-Age-into-dad-rock music was so cringe. So when a prick in my arm and the smell of an alcohol swab signaled the beginning of my trip, I was relieved to hear Steve Roach’s <em>Structures from Silence</em>, and Don Slepian’s “Sea of Bliss” through the headphones I’d been provided with as aI sank into an other-space that felt like the backstage green room of reality. “The music is so… good…” I croaked, pulling the blindfolds off my face and gazing around the room still cross-eyed. Later, Matt told me that he’d curated the playlist purposely to soothe the fear I’d expressed about “jumping off the cliff of consciousness.” </p><p>Increasingly, researchers and facilitators are paying attention to the role of music in psychedelic therapy. In the same way that music that resonates with your tastes can be the key to a profound experience, <a href="https://www.ecstaticintegration.org/p/music-is-the-medicine">experiments have shown</a> that bad music can also trigger a difficult trip. I’m excited that more musicians are exploring the possibilities of making music for psychedelic therapy, and that ketamine clinics like LACKC are making these services more accessible and appealing to the creative class. If you have some cash to spare, I recommend checking them out… you probably already know you love listening to ambient on ketamine, but doing this in therapeutic setting—where there are literal doctors checking your vitals and giving you blankets lol—feels so much safer than a chaotic club environment. Why not try going deep? </p><h2>💊 THE SCOOP</h2><ul><li><p>This is an insane story of political intrigue revolving around ICE’s involvement in cocaine drug trafficking that reporter Penn Bullock—who happened to be my gay husband in high school—has been excavating for almost a decade (and it shows).

Apple was barely out of the garage, the first web browser was more than a decade away, and the mobile internet remained a fancy of science fiction.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past 50 years, Vinod has witnessed and participated in multiple tectonic technological shifts, from the protean proliferation of the internet to the advancement of computation biology to the imminence of superior artificial intelligence. In that time, he has been the contemporary, employer, or backer of the industry’s most consequential entrepreneurs and executives: Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Eric Schmidt, Jack Dorsey, Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and many, many more. He has, in short, one of the greatest longitudinal views of high-performance innovation of anyone on earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that, I was particularly keen to hear what patterns or shared traits Vinod has observed over the years from partnering with some of the world’s most inventive, disruptive people.&nbsp;</p><p>To hear the characteristics Vinod finds predictive and learn which up-and-coming founders he considers especially exciting, read on.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lessons from Vinod</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Flexibility and stubbornness. </strong>The best entrepreneurs are “flexible in their tactics but obstinate in their vision,” according to Vinod. They must be willing to adapt to the game on the field but constantly keep their end goal in mind. Sam Altman and Patrick Collison are founders Vinod believes exemplify these traits.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Discerning learners</strong>. To survive as a startup CEO, you must be or become a learning machine. The job is so varied that it requires you to level up, day after day, week after week. Exceptional founders are not only fast learners; they are discerning ones. They have no problem throwing out bad ideas, even if presented by a perceived authority figure. They’re equally happy to accept good ones, no matter their provenance.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Some problems are too important</strong>. There are dozens of frameworks and heuristics venture capitalists use to analyze potential investments. For some opportunities, Vinod asks himself a simple, but powerful question: how crucial a problem is this startup solving? Over the years, the Khosla Ventures boss has backed companies principally because they were “too important <em>not</em> to do.” Think nuclear fission, AGI, or plant-based meat.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Keep reading for several more insights from Vinod.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>The Vinod Khosla Collection</h2><p>Today’s letter marks the end of my correspondence with Silicon Valley legend Vinod Khosla.

To build a great and durable company, he argues, founders must ignore traditional wisdom and learn how kindred spirits like Steve Jobs ran their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul refers to this as “founder mode,” a style of building that sits in opposition to the “manager mode” espoused in most business books.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a topic I’ve been thinking about for some time now, greatly aided by the clarity and language of Paul’s piece. Last month, for example, we published <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/the-elon-musk-playbook">The Elon Musk Playbook</a>, highlighting how the SpaceX and Tesla founder’s management runs counter to the orthodoxy.&nbsp;</p><p>I have also thought about Founder Mode a great deal in the context of our correspondence. Over these past few months, we’ve explored your early entrepreneurial origins, the differentiated ways you built management teams and instilled high-leverage cultures, and the extraordinary builders you’ve partnered with. You have lived in Founder Mode and known many of the best to architect their companies in this style, from Jeff Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin to Elon Musk to Patrick Collison to Max Levchin to Brian Chesky, the man that spawned the post. You have known many of the great managers, too, such as your initial inspiration Andy Grove, and old employee, Eric Schmidt.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout our correspondence, there have been anecdotes that seem to capture some of the Founder Mode ethos. For example, in one of our previous exchanges, you noted there had been a debate at Square about whether to launch Cash App. Had Jack Dorsey listened to the conventional wisdom of maintaining singular focus, he would have lost out on much of Square’s market cap.</p><p>It’s a neat example of the kind of contrarian decisions founders have to make and hints at the people behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In our final letter, I would love to focus on this fertile ground. Of the great founders you’ve worked with, what unites them? When you meet an entrepreneur, what signals portend real promise? As they develop, what decisions do they make that less gifted founders might not? As much as you’re able to articulate, I’m keen to understand how you filter for exceptional entrepreneurial talent as an investor and what collaborating with these people has taught you about innovation and constructing large, durable businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>The names we’ve mentioned so far are all well-known and lauded as luminaries in our industry. As you look toward the next decade, which founders do you think have the opportunity to join their ranks? Do you find that the way you work with contemporary founders – the advice you offer, for instance – has changed over the years? What advice would you give to other founders just beginning their journeys? Your career has allowed you to build one of the best personal, longitudinal samples of great entrepreneurs in history. I would love to hear the observations it has sparked.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I just want to end with gratitude. When embarking on this correspondence, I knew I would find it fascinating and fulfilling. However, I didn’t fully appreciate just <em>how </em>fascinating and fulfilling it would be. I’ve learned the power of ignoring your failures, the unreasonable tenacity that can turn even the firmest “no” into a “yes,” the simple but effective way to identify and recruit talented employees, the shape of supertrends (and the rewards they can yield), and much more. It is not an exaggeration to say that your stories have helped me dream a little bigger, be willing to risk a little more, and persevere with added ferocity. I am sure the same is true for many of our readers as they build and back the companies of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>With my sincere thanks,</p><p>Mario</p><div><hr></div><h2>Vinod’s response</h2><p><strong>Subject</strong>: Founder Mode<br><strong>From</strong>: Vinod Khosla<br><strong>To</strong>: Mario Gabriele<br><strong>Date</strong>: Wednesday, September 25 2024 at 10:59 AM PST</p><p>Mario,&nbsp;</p><p>It has been fun to have this conversation with you over the last many months. I am glad it has been helpful to you, and hopefully to many other founders as well.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re right that I’ve gotten to work with many great entrepreneurs who have built incredible companies. Every founder is different, of course, but they do have shared traits.&nbsp;</p><p>What I’m looking for in a founder, above all, is someone<strong> flexible in their tactics but obstinate in their vision.</strong> Patrick Collison is a great example of a founder who is flexible in his tactics. He learns extremely quickly and is able to adapt and iterate. Sam Altman from OpenAI, Max Rhodes from Faire, and Max Levchin from Affirm are other good examples.&nbsp;</p><p>If you sit down with Patrick, for example, you can see how fast he processes. He asks a ton of questions. He wants all the input from you. And based on the feedback he gets from his questions, he’s happy to change his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>People like Patrick or Sam <strong>quickly accept good ideas and reject bad ones</strong>. If they receive new information that invalidates their opinions, they change their minds. If they receive unconvincing information, even if it comes from an authority figure, they reject it easily. They’re not arrogant about their thinking. They just want to find the best answer.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/vinod-khoslas-founder-mode">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   </body></html>	Key insights from tech titans on leadership, innovation, and building successful companies in the digital age.	2024-10-01 11:55:12	2024-10-07 08:07:10.383	2024-10-14 08:10:24.979	{vc}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57ebdf19-e3c0-4bd2-b18b-e3e10cb0616a_3742x2839.jpeg	Mario Gabriele	vinod-khoslas-founder-mode

If you want to experience the post a different way, I used the <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">truly impressive NotebookLM</a> by Google to turn it into a podcast. Literally the only thing I did was feed it the text below, everything else was generated by the AI (it is surprisingly accurate, though it appears to actually build on some of these ideas).

We know this is happening in the EU, <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insights/the-adoption-of-chatgpt/">where a representative study of knowledge workers in Denmark</a> from January found that 65% of marketers, 64% of journalists, 30% of lawyers, among others, had used AI at work. We also know it from a<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60832ecef615231cedd30911/t/66f0c3fbabdc0a173e1e697e/1727054844024/BBD_GenAI_NBER_Sept2024.pdf"> new study of American workers</a> in August, where a third of workers had used Generative AI at work in the last week. (ChatGPT is by far the most used tool in that study, followed by Google’s Gemini)</p></li><li><p>We know that individuals are seeing productivity gains at work for some important tasks. You have almost certainly seen me reference <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged">our work showing consultants completed 18 different tasks 25% more quickly</a> using GPT-4. But another <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566">new study of actual deployments of the original GitHub Copilot for coding</a> found a 26% improvement in productivity (and this used the now-obsolete GPT-3.5 and is far less advanced than current coding tools). This aligns with self-reported data. For example, the Denmark study found that users thought that AI halved their working time for 41% of the tasks they do at work.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png" width="1456" height="592" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:233186,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Yet, when I talk to leaders and managers about AI use in their company, they often say they see little AI use and few productivity gains outside of narrow permitted use cases. So how do we reconcile these two experiences with the points above?</p><p>The answer is that AI use that boosts individual performance does not always translate to boosting organizational performance for a variety of reasons. To get organizational gains requires R&amp;D into AI use and you are largely going to have to do the R&amp;D yourself. I want to repeat that: <em>you are largely going to have to do the R&amp;D yourself</em>. For decades, companies have outsourced their organizational innovation to consultants or enterprise software vendors who develop generalized approaches based on what they see across many organizations. That won’t work here, at least for a while. Nobody has special information about how to best use AI at your company, or a playbook for how to integrate it into your organization. Even the major AI companies <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1819832350345396469">release models without knowing how they can be best used</a>, discovering use cases as they are shared on Twitter (fine, X). They especially don’t know your industry, organization, or context. We are all figuring this out together. If you want to gain an advantage, you are going to have to figure it out faster.</p><p>So how do you do R&amp;D on ways of using AI? You turn to the Crowd or the Lab. Probably both.</p><h1>Tactics for the Crowd</h1><p>One of my advisors during my PhD at MIT was Prof. Eric von Hippel, who famously developed the concept of user innovation - that many key breakthrough innovations come not from central R&amp;D labs, but from people actually using products and tinkering with them to solve their own problems (<a href="https://evhippel.mit.edu/">you can read a lot about this research on his website</a>). A key reason for this is that experimentation is hard and expensive for outsiders trying to develop new products, but very cheap for workers doing their own tasks. As users are very motivated to make their own jobs easier with technology, they find ways to do so. The user advantage is especially big in experimenting with Generative AI because the systems are unreliable and have a jagged frontier of capability. Experts can easily assess when an AI is useful for their work through trial and error, but an outsider often cannot.</p><p>From the surveys, and many conversations, I know that people are experimenting with AI and finding it very useful. But they aren’t sharing their results with their employers. Instead, almost every organization is completely infiltrated with Secret Cyborgs, people using AI work but not telling you about it.</p><h3>You want Secret Cyborgs? This is how you get Secret Cyborgs</h3><p> Here are a bunch of common reasons people don’t share their AI experiments inside organizations:</p><ul><li><p>They received a scary talk about how improper AI use might be punished. Maybe the talk was vague on what improper use was. Maybe they don’t even want to ask. They don’t want to be punished, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They are being treated as heroes at work for their sensitive emails and rapid coding ability. They suspect if they tell anyone it is AI, people will respect them less, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They know that companies see productivity gains as an opportunity for cost cutting. They suspect that they or their colleagues will be fired if the company realizes that AI does some of their job, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They suspect that if they reveal their AI use, even if they aren’t punished, they won’t be rewarded. They aren’t going to give away what they know for free, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They know that even if companies don’t cut costs and reward their use, any productivity gains will just become an expectation that more work will get done, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They are incentivized to show people their approaches, but they have no way of sharing how they use AI, so they hide their use.</p></li></ul><h3>Getting help from your Cyborgs</h3><p>So how can companies solve this problem? By taking these things seriously.</p><p>First, you need to reduce the fear. Instead of vague talks on AI ethics or terrifying blanket policies, provide clear areas where experimentation of any kind is permitted and be biased towards allowing people to use AI where it is ethically and legally possible (as a side note, many internal legal departments have an outdated view of the risks of AI). Rules and ethical standards are obviously important, but need to be clear and well-understood, not draconian. And fixing policies isn’t enough. Figure out how you will guarantee to your workers that revealing their productivity gains will not lead to layoffs, because it is <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/latent-expertise-everyone-is-in-r">often a bad idea to use technological gains to fire workers at a moment of massive change</a>. For companies with good cultures, this will be easier, but for those where employees have little faith in management, you may need to resort to extreme measures to show that <em>this time</em> you aren’t going to use new technology as an excuse to lay off workers. <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety">Psychological safety</a> is often the key to a willingness to share innovation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png" width="446" height="363.8285052143685" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:863,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:446,&quot;bytes&quot;:183108,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Take a look at just a part of this suggested model AI policy from <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/pdf/practical-guidance/ai/pgexpert-annotated-form-ai-driven-tools-in-the-workplace.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOorwwZdIq8y9fb8u5qY2MveyTtj0fqDq6_epIjpDU3MH-pZQCMbb">LexisNexis</a> and you will quickly see why many employees might not want to “officially” use AI at work</figcaption></figure></div><p>Second, you need to align your award systems. Figure out how to reward people for revealing AI use. If productivity gains happen, workers need to benefit as well. That might mean giving really big awards for really big gains. Think cash prizes that cover months of salary. Promotions. Corner offices. The ability to work from home forever. With the potential productivity gains possible due to LLMs, these are small prices to pay for truly breakthrough innovation. And large incentives also show that the organization is serious.</p><p>Third, model positive use. Executives should be obviously using AI and sharing their use cases with the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/t6xc-_m47_0?si=pZuGzM6XoON0QOJB&amp;t=393">Watch Mary Erdoes, CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset and Wealth Management Group, talk about how the firm is prioritizing AI use at the leadership level, and incorporating their AI experiences into their strategic thinking</a>. And once they become users, managers can encourage their employees to turn to AI first to try to solve their problems. For example, Cynthia Gumbert, CMO of SmartBear, told me that when teams come to her for resources for a new project, if she thinks AI could help, she tells them “Prove to me you can’t do it in AI first, then maybe I will fund the work.”</p><p>Give others the opportunity to show their uses as well. Public-facing events like hackathons (especially including non-technical experts, <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/strategies-for-an-accelerating-future?utm_source=publication-search">I found my MBAs were able to develop useful GPTs for their various jobs, regardless of technical status</a>) and prompt sharing sessions often work well. You also need to think about how to build a community. AI talent can be anywhere in your organization. How are you finding the people who are enthusiastic and talented, and helping them share what they have learned?</p><p>Of course, you also need to give your employees access to tools and training. For tools, that usually means giving them the ability to play directly with a frontier model (probably Claude 3.5, GPT-4o, or Gemini 1.5, through one of many providers) and systems like OpenAI’s GPTs, Claude’s Projects or Google’s Gems that allow them to develop and share more complete solutions. Training is a bit more of a challenge because there is still a lot of discussion over ways to use AI (<a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/captains-log-the-irreducible-weirdness">I gave some advice based on the prompting research  here)</a>, but even just an introductory session can give people permission to innovate.  </p><p>The innovation talent for AI is inside your organization. You need to create the opportunity for it to flourish. The Crowd can help. But there is also a role for a more focused innovation effort: the Lab.</p><h1>Tactics for the Lab</h1><p>As important as decentralized innovation is, there is also a role for a more centralized effort to figure out how to use R&amp;D in your organization. The Lab needs to consist of subject matter experts and a mix of technologists and non-technologists. Fortunately, the Crowd provides your researchers. Those enthusiasts who figure out how to use AI and proudly share it with the company are some of the talents you will use to staff the Lab. Their job will be completely, or mostly, about AI. You need them to focus on building, not analysis or abstract strategy. Here is what they will build:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Build AI benchmarks for your organization. </strong>I<a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/superhuman"> have ranted about the state of benchmarks in AI before</a>, but almost all the AI Labs test on coding and multiple-choice tests of knowledge. These don’t tell you which AI is the most stylish writer or can handle financial data or can best read through a legal document. You need to develop your own benchmarks: how good are each of the models at the tasks you actually do inside of your company? A set of clear business-critical tasks and criteria for evaluating them is key (<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/develop-tests">Anthropic has a guide to benchmarking that can help as a starting place</a>). Without these benchmarks, you are flying blind. You have no idea how good AI systems are, and, even more importantly, you do not know how good they are getting. If you had benchmarks, you would know whether the new o-1 models represent an opportunity or threat, or if they are closing the gap with human performance. Most organizations have no idea.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build prompts and tools that work. </strong>Take the ideas from the Crowd and turn them into fast and dirty products. Iterate and test them. Then release them into your organization and measure what happens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build stuff that doesn’t work… yet. </strong>What would it look like if you used AI agents to do all the work for key business processes? Build it and see where it fails. Then, when a new model comes out, plug it into what you built and see if it is any better. If the rate of advancement continues, this gives you the opportunity to get a first glance at where things are heading, and to actually have a deployable prototype at the first moment AI models improve past critical thresholds.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png" width="2868" height="1034" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1034,&quot;width&quot;:2868,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:563671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">An example of magic and a provocation for academics - I gave the new Gemini model 18 of my academic papers and asked it to write a tenure statement, a process which takes months for humans and is one of the more challenging tasks for academics.

Show how far you can get with an impossible task with AI, or what the latest tools can accomplish. Get the people going.</p></li></ul><p>The Crowd innovates and the Lab builds and tests. A successful internal R&amp;D effort likely involves both.</p><h1>This is just a start</h1><p>In the longer term, innovation is not enough to thrive if AI abilities continue to advance, instead companies will need AI-aware leadership. Our organizations are built around the limitations and benefits of human intelligence, the only form we have had available to us. <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/reshaping-the-tree-rebuilding-organizations">Now, we must figure out how to reconfigure processes and organizational structures that have been developed over decades to take into account the weird “intelligence” of AIs</a>. That requires going beyond R&amp;D to consider organizational structures and goals, and what the role of people and machines are in the organization of the future. The right way to do this is not yet clear, but should be something companies, and the consultants and academics who advise them, need to start working on now.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png" width="471" height="219.9766881028939" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:581,&quot;width&quot;:1244,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:471,&quot;bytes&quot;:38199,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And yet this may not be radical enough. The explicit goal of the AI labs is to build AIs that are better than humans at every intellectual tasks. They have promised that soon we will have agents - autonomous AIs with goals that can plan and act on their own. Ultimately, as OpenAI’s roadmap shows, they believe they can create AIs that do the work of organizations. None of this may happen, but even if just some it does, the changes to organizations become far more profound, in ways that are difficult to imagine today. For companies, the best way to navigate this uncertainty is to take back some agency and begin to explore this new world for themselves.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png" width="497" height="312.06976744186045" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1376,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:497,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>And, for fun, I asked Claude to turn this post into a fantasy novel and created a second podcast.

Extreme weather event attribution has long been among the topics most requested by THB readers. In this first post in the series, I introduce some key concepts that will be important as the series evolves over the coming weeks and months. I’m counting on your engagement throughout the series.</p><p><em>Weather event attribution</em> does not appear in the <a href="https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/">IPCC Glossary</a>, however it does appear in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/">the body of the AR6 report</a>, where the IPCC explains that event attribution research seeks to “to attribute aspects of specific extreme weather and climate events to certain causes.” </p><p>The IPCC <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/">continues</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Scientists cannot answer directly whether a particular event was caused by climate change,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> as extremes do occur naturally, and any specific weather and climate event is the result of a complex mix of human and natural factors. Instead, scientists quantify the relative importance of human and natural influences on the magnitude and/or probability of specific extreme weather events.” </p></blockquote><p>In future installments we will get into the gory details — the strengths and weaknesses — of the various approaches to event attribution studies. With this post I want to introduce three starting points for our discussions which will unfold over a series of posts in coming weeks and months.</p><p>First, event attribution research is a form of <em><a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review">tactical science</a> </em>— research performed explicitly to serve legal and political ends. This is not my opinion, but has been openly stated on many occasions by the researchers who developed and perform event attribution research.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Such research is not always subjected to peer review, and this is <a href="https://ascmo.copernicus.org/articles/6/177/2020/ascmo-6-177-2020.pdf">often by design</a> as peer-review takes much longer than the news cycle. Instead, event attribution studies are generally promoted via press release.</p><p>For instance, researchers behind the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03071-7">explain </a>that one of their key motives in conducting such studies is, “increasing the ‘immediacy’ of climate change, thereby increasing support for mitigation.” WWA’s chief scientist, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060775163">Friederike Otto, explains</a>, “Unlike every other branch of climate science or science in general, event attribution was actually originally suggested with the courts in mind.” Another oft-quoted scientist who performs rapid attribution analyses, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/trump-says-florence-is-just-mother-nature-a-stunning-new-climate-study-says-hes-wrong-7bf6311110be/">Michael Wehner</a>, summarized their importance (emphasis in original) — “The most important message from this (and previous) analyses is that “<strong>Dangerous climate change is here now!</strong>” </p><p>Weather event attribution methodologies have been developed not just to feed media narratives or support general climate advocacy. Otto and others have been very forthright that the main function of such studies is to create a defensible scientific basis in support of lawsuits against fossil fuel companies — She explains the strategy in detail in this interview, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV47jTQ9Om4">From Extreme Event Attribution to Climate Litigation</a>.</p><p>As I recently argued, tactical science is not necessarily bad science, but it should elevate the degree of scrutiny that such analyses face, especially when they generally are not subjected to independent peer review. In this series I’ll apply some scrutiny and invite you to participate as we go along.</p><p>Second, extreme event attribution was developed as a response to <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-no-stinking-science">the failure of the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution (D&amp;A) to reach high confidence</a> in the detection of increasing trends in the frequency or intensity of most types of impactful extreme events — notably hurricanes, floods, drought, and tornadoes. </p><p>Here is how I <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-be-a-smart-consumer-of-climate">recently explained</a> the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution:</p><blockquote><p>To ensure rigor in its work, the IPCC has employed a statistical framework for concluding that extreme weather phenomena has actually increased (or decreased) and the factors responsible for such changes. The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/glossary/">detection of changes</a></em>&nbsp;required quantifying a change in the statistics of weather extremes over climate time scales of 30 years or even longer. Once detection was achieved, then scientists seek to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/glossary/">attribute those changes</a></em>&nbsp;to particular causes, including the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p><p>When it comes to many types of extreme events&nbsp;<a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-understand-the-new-ipcc-report-1e3">the IPCC has for decades</a>&nbsp;been unable to conclusively detect changes in their frequency or intensity. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">the IPCC has reported</a>&nbsp;increases in heat waves and in heavy precipitation, but not tropical cyclones (including hurricanes), floods, tornadoes or drought.</p></blockquote><p>The IPCC’s inability to reach high confidence in detection and attribution of most types of extreme events has been viewed by climate advocates as politically problematic. For instance, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017EF000665">Elizabeth Lloyd and Naomi Oreskes argue</a> that the IPCC’s lack of strong claims on extreme event detection and attribution,</p><blockquote><p>“. . . conveys the impression that we just do not know, which feeds into both contrarian claims that climate science is in a state of high uncertainty, doubt, or incompleteness, and the general tendency of humans to discount threats that are not imminent.”</p></blockquote><p>The underlying theory of change here appears to be that people must be fearful of climate change and thus need come to understand that it threatens their lives, not in the future, but today and tomorrow. If they don’t have that fear, the argument goes, then they will discount the threat and fail to support the <em>right </em>climate policies. Hence, from this perspective, the IPCC”s failure to reach strong claims of detection and attribution represents a political problem — a problem that can be rectified via the invention of extreme event attribution.</p><p>The IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 acknowledges extreme event attribution research in its <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/">Chapter 11</a> but does not privilege it over the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution. The IPCC AR6 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12/">Chapter 12</a> relies on the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution, and appears to dismiss event attribution studies with a single sentence, </p><blockquote><p>“The usefulness or applicability of available extreme event attribution methods for assessing climate-related risks remains subject to debate.”</p></blockquote><p>I expect that there is to come a significant collision between those researchers who support the conventional IPCC approach to detection and attribution and those of a more activist inclination who favor single event attribution. This expected conflict will be the subject of a future post in this series.</p><p>Third, and finally for today, I want to once again <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-climate-fix-book-club-chapter-53c">emphasize the reality and risks of changes in climate due to human activities</a> — notably the burning of fossil fuels, but also land use change, particulate pollution, and other forcings. The importance of climate change as an issue does not mean that we can or should ignore scientific integrity. We live in a time when far too often calls for scientific integrity are criticized by political campaigners (including scientists) when certain scientific understandings do not align perfectly with this or that political agenda.</p><p>For example, some dismiss entirely the possibility of human-caused changes in climate while others quickly claim that every weather event is more extreme or more common due to climate change. These extreme positions are roughly aligned with the far right and far left respectively — and discussion of climate science and policy has long been dominated by these extremes. </p><p>Climate science is not, or at least should not serve as, a proxy for political tribes. As this series evolves I’ll make arguments backed up by logic and evidence.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> You might or might not find these arguments convincing!

Bad science is where data is have been cherry-picked— when some data have been deliberately left out—or it’s impossible for the reader to understand the steps that were taken to produce or analyze the data. It is a set of claims that can’t be tested, claims that are based on samples that are too small, and claims that don’t follow from the evidence provided. And science is bad—or at least weak—when proponents of a position jump to conclusions on insufficient or inconsistent data.”</p></blockquote><p>Few would disagree with the Oreskes and Conway criteria of “bad science,” but how do we use the criteria to distinguish bad science from good science? Oreskes and Conway have an answer (emphasis in original):</p><blockquote><p>“But while these scientific criteria may be clear in principle, knowing when they apply in practice is a judgment call. For this scientists rely on peer review. Peer review is a topic that is impossible to make sexy, but it’s crucial to understand, because it is what makes science science—and not just a form of <em>opinion</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Oreskes and Conway characterize “Potemkin village science” as the efforts of “merchants of doubt” to make their bad-science arguments look science-like using data and graphs — to fool the uninformed and contest the good science in the peer-reviewed literature. The good guys publish in peer reviewed publications, while the bad guys do not.</p><p>The idealization of peer review as the arbiter of good science is problematic for many reasons, but one is that it downplays the possibility that bad science can appear in the peer reviewed literature and good science outside of those outlets. </p><p>Today, I focus on the use and abuse of the peer reviewed literature to produce <em>tactical science</em> which I define as:</p><blockquote><p>Publications — often targeted for the peer reviewed literature — designed and constructed to serve extra-scientific ends, typically efforts to shape public opinion, influence politics, or serve legal action.</p></blockquote><p>I first became aware of tactical science in 2008, when Princeton professor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101116080021/http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/34156">Stephen Pacala explained candidly</a> that his famous 2004 “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1100103">stabilization wedges</a>” paper (with Robert Socolow) was actually written to serve political ends and to marginalize other researchers:</p><blockquote><p>“The purpose of the stabilization wedges paper was narrow and simple – we wanted to stop the Bush administration from what we saw as a strategy to stall action on global warming by claiming that we lacked the technology to tackle it. The Secretary of Energy at the time used to give a speech saying that we needed a discovery as fundamental as the discovery of electricity by Faraday in the 19th century.</p><p>We also wanted to stop the group of scientists that were writing what I thought were grant proposals masquerading as energy assessments. There was <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1072357">one famous paper published in </a><em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1072357">Science</a></em> that went down the list [of available technologies] fighting them one by one but never asked "what if we put them all together?" It was an analysis whose purpose was to show we lacked the technology, with a call at the end for blue sky research.</p><p>I saw it as an unhealthy collusion between the scientific community who believed that there was a serious problem and a political movement that didn’t. I wanted that to stop and the paper for me was surprisingly effective at doing that. I’m really happy with how it came out – I wouldn’t change a thing.”</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png" width="482" height="482" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:482,&quot;bytes&quot;:1491476,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Scientists say . . .</figcaption></figure></div><p>Since then, I’ve seen tactical science become increasingly prevalent in the climate science literature.

From the Woodwell Climate Research Center, which is funded by McKinsey — a heavy user of RCP8.5, the paper also justifies the continued prioritization of RCP8.5. The <a href="https://x.com/RogerPielkeJr/status/1290638311732600832">paper relies on fanciful assumptions</a> of massive increases in land use carbon dioxide emissions completely at odds with observations and the IPCC.</p></li></ul><p>None of the three papers above disclosed the interests of funders in the published results of the analyses.

For instance, a <a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/crits-christoph-et-al-2024-retraction">group of scientists</a> focused on opening up debate on COVID-19 origins have systematically alleged that a suite of papers arguing for a market-based origin are, “<a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/crits-christoph-et-al-2024-retraction">based on invalid premises and conclusions, or are potentially products of scientific misconduct — including fraud</a>.” Of course, <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/why-proximal-origins-must-be-retracted">here at THB</a> and <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/proximal-origins-scientific-integrity">for the U.S. Congress</a> I have extensively documented how the so-called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9">Proximal Origins</a> paper provides perhaps the most well-known example of tactical science.</p><p>What are we to do about tactical science? I have a few suggestions:</p><ul><li><p>First, we should all recognize that peer-review provides a minimal standard of review. It certainly does not provide a demarcation between good and bad science. There is plenty of very good science not in peer reviewed journals and plenty of dreck in peer reviewed journals — and this has always been the case, well beyond issues of tactical science.</p></li><li><p>We experts should pay close attention to peer-reviewed papers after they are published — the claims they make, the evidence they employ, the methods they use, and the potentially overlapping interests of funders and authors. In short, a peer reviewed publication represents just one, arguably early, step in evaluating scientific claims. This lesson is one that has motivated interest in recent years in replication and reproduction of scientific analyses.</p></li><li><p>The scientific community needs to do a much better job ensuring that the institutions of science — including but not limited to journals — are simply doing their jobs. For instance, I recently documented how <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/a-thb-follow-up-climate-research">PNAS refused to retract a paper</a> that used a “dataset” that does not exist. I also recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44304-024-00011-0">published a paper</a> on the many problems with the politically-opportune “billion dollar disaster” tabulation.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> Journal editors are also people with interests in tactics. An entire Substack could be devoted to tactical science.</p></li><li><p>For journalists and the broader public it is important to understand that peer review does not organically produce truth and that the same forces that shape public debates over scientific claims also show up in research and publishing. It’s complicated, that is just a fact. </p></li></ul><p>Knowing what is good science and what is bad science is more difficult than ever in 2024. Some offer simple shortcuts to the truth — Look at the author’s funding, perhaps their politics, the virtuousness of the causes they support, or perhaps appeal to authority, consensus, or ask a fact checker in the media. The broader context within which research takes place is useful to know but does not offer us a shortcut to the truth.</p><p>As I often say, there is no shortcut — science <em>is</em> the shortcut.</p><p>Peer reviewed journals have increasingly become another arena of political conflict on issues that are politically contentious. Science and politics are of course impossible to keep totally separate. However, the good news is that we are well prepared to make judgments between good and bad science, should we wish to. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

population:</p><blockquote><p>“In the end, aging plays the starring role”</p></blockquote><p>The trend is <em>not</em> primarily due to the expansion of social programs: </p><blockquote><p>“The expansion of the social safety net—new programs, increased generosity, and increased coverage—explains only a small portion of the overall rise in the transfer share.”</p></blockquote><p>There is considerable variation across communities, but aging represents a national-level dynamic:</p><blockquote><p>“[T]he 65 and over share of the population and the poverty rate are not strongly correlated with each other, with a correlation coefficient of -0.014.</p><p>This suggests that each is useful for explaining transfer levels across the map, but that they apply in different places, and only one—aging—is good at explaining nationwide changes in transfers over time.</p><p>In part, this is because many deeply economically distressed and high-transfer areas—the heart of Appalachia, for example—have been distressed and transfer-dependent for a long time, while aging has been a much more dynamic phenomenon that has also affected more places.”</p></blockquote><p>Let’s reemphasize this point:</p><blockquote><p>“[T]he nation’s poor population is growing nowhere near as quickly as its elderly population.

It is bad for what it signals about the economic health of American communities, and it is bad for the fiscal health of the country.</p><p>Across huge swathes of the American map, aging has pushed transfers higher while local economic struggles have suppressed growth in other earnings. The result is a reshaping of how communities derive their livelihood—and a fading importance of work and productive activity in generating local incomes.”</p></blockquote><p>Our traditional politics would suggest that to try to boost GDP growth and reduce reliance on government transfers, those on the political right will emphasize cutting government spending on transfers and those on the political left will emphasize raising taxes. EIG cautions that neither approach alone can work — and even with both, more needs to be done:</p><blockquote><p>The country is on a collision course with politically fraught trade-offs. Raising revenues through significantly increased taxes could choke off the very economic activity that finances transfers. Dramatically cutting spending on programs and benefits would unravel parts of the safety net that dignify life in the United States. Tax hikes and entitlement reform are also not enough to solve the problem, either alone or together. Both options must be part of the solution—but not the only part.</p></blockquote><p>What else needs to occur? Greater economic growth:</p><blockquote><p>Faster economic growth is essential to regaining the path back to fiscal health. Investments in research and innovation, an expansive and better designed immigration policy, tax and regulatory policies that foster economic dynamism and participation in the workforce—these and other parts of a growth agenda represent the ideal way to reduce dependence on transfers, by boosting incomes earned from work and investing.</p></blockquote><p>I would hypothesize that there is some degree of correlation between those places that have seen “significant” government transfers and higher Trump shares of the 2020 vote (you can eyeball the figure below). The reason for that hypothesis is that many communities with “significant” government transfers are — as explained above — “subsisting” but not “thriving.”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> In contrast, many communities that are “thriving” have “moderate” or “minimal” government transfers. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png" width="452" height="615" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:615,&quot;width&quot;:452,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:346867,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sources: Top, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election">Wikipedia</a>; Bottom, <a href="https://eig.org/great-transfermation/">EIG 2024</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Democrats have <a href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/how-trump-wins">increasingly become the party of the educated, wealthy elite</a>, they become identified — rightly or wrongly — as those who bear responsibility for the underlying reasons for those left behind, as the make-up of the U.S. and global economies have shifted. Trump’s populist MAGA appeal taps into this vein, but ironically, offers nothing in the way of sensible policy to “foster economic dynamism.” Kamala Harris apparently understands this, making an “<a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf">opportunity economy</a>” central to her rhetoric. But the Harris campaign as well suffers from a lack of sensible policy to “foster economic dynamism.”</p><p>That leaves us with vibes and partisan politics.

In fact, give demographic projections they will likely get worse in the absence of effective action.</p><p>The United States is going to have to again take seriously the importance of policies underlying improved economic growth. These policies are not going to be simple slogans and necessarily will draw from thinking on the right and on the left. To be effective they will necessitate compromise and pragmatism. That is a big ask for 2025, but the alternatives are much worse.</p><p>The EIG reports concludes:</p><blockquote><p>Not since the aftermath of World War II has the country been forced to confront such a troubling fiscal situation. In recent years the federal debt has returned to those all-time highs as a share of GDP—only it has happened through the normal course of business rather than the exigencies of war. The country now runs historically large deficits at every point in the business cycle.</p><p>In the immediate post-war period, favorable demographics could be counted on to grow the economy back to fiscal sustainability. No such tailwind exists today. That is why, to truly address the underlying challenge, a growth agenda must include a heavy focus on making it easier to start and sustain families. Demographic vitality and economic vitality go hand in hand.</p><p>If there is a silver lining, it is that the rapid aging of the U.S. population is, at least relative to the same trend in other advanced economies, a new phenomenon. By reinvigorating the productive capacity and demographic health of the United States, it is still possible to prevent the country from becoming an ever more dependent one—but only if we get started now.</p></blockquote><p>For further reading:</p><p>Burgess, M.

right.</p><p>You really don’t.</p><p>But you do set the pace of the company as the founder.</p><p>If you take a day to respond to your team’s messages, or put together a draft of something, they certainly won’t put in the extra effort to be fast either.</p><p>The best founders I know get things down on paper and start moving as fast as possible. They ship quickly and get in front of customers quickly.</p><p>That’s why I like this idea of “first draft speed” from Shaan Puri.</p><p>If VCs were easily able to measure this when considering making an investment, I believe we’d have a much higher hit rate in the industry.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank"

Fundraising is important but it’s a distraction keeping founders away from daily business operations. This is why you want to run a tight process to give yourself the highest chances of success without dragging on for months on end.&nbsp;</p><p>After reading <a href="https://thevccorner.substack.com/p/running-a-fundraising-process?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_content=feed%3Arecommended%3Acopy_link">Part I</a>, you understand the importance of targeting the right investors, how to get connected with them, and why you need to build a relationship before you start raising. All of this sets the ground for what we will cover in today’s article: How to run a successful fundraising process.&nbsp;</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Preparing for the fundraise</strong></p><ol><li><p>What to include in your pitch deck</p></li><li><p>Structuring your Virtual Data Room (VDR)</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Running the fundraise process</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Staying connected after the fundraise</strong></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3><strong>4. Preparing for the fundraise</strong></h3><p>Before telling your preferred investors of your intention to raise, there are few items you need to figure out:</p><ol><li><p>How much money do you intend to raise?</p></li><li><p>What type of security (Priced Round, SAFE, Convertible Note)?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How much dilution are you willing to accept/what valuation are you targeting?&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>These parameters might change as you receive feedback from investors or advisors, but you need these ironed out as a starting point. You need to have your own threshold for what you’ll accept because some investors, even if they like your company, might pass right away if you are too far apart on the funding amount or valuation. At the earlier stages, it’s common to opt for a SAFE to delay the dilution/valuation question, but it becomes increasingly relevant over time.</p><p>This is why it’s important to keep an eye on fundraising trends for other companies at similar stages and verticals since investors will often reference these. You can find benchmarks from different resources such as Carta or different VC reports . With these details ironed out, you must create a pitch deck. The pitch deck is arguably the most important part of your fundraising process; this is what generates excitement from investors, convincing them to take a closer look. These days, at the earlier stages some founders are opting for Loom videos, investment memos or other formats, these can work too. You just need to ensure you pass this first gate to convince investors to invest time and resources in performing due diligence. (see <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-148330728?source=queue&amp;autoPlay=false">The Ultimate Pitch Deck Collection</a>)</p><h4>4.1 What to include in your pitch deck</h4><p>You can design or structure your pitch deck any way you like but at a minimum, what is important to investors is that you address the following:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Concept/Product</strong></p><ol><li><p>What are you building/product overview</p></li><li><p>The opportunity (<em>TAM</em>)</p></li><li><p>Why now (<em>trends</em>)?</p></li><li><p>Company vision</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Team</strong></p><ol><li><p>Founding team profiles</p></li><li><p>Why are you the right group to achieve this vision</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Commercial</strong></p><ol><li><p>Go to market motion (direct sales, partners, marketplace etc.)</p></li><li><p>Current traction (signed customers, pilots, pipeline etc.)</p></li><li><p>Product feedback</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>There are many other slides or sections you can include but at the earlier stages, VCs will mostly focus on the concept and the founding team. At the later stages they will be more focused on commercial execution and financials. It’s common to have different versions of the pitch deck, a shorter version that you can share externally and a longer one reserved for investors that have demonstrated more interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like with Investor Updates, you need to be careful with whom you share it, since it could be passed to other investors or competitors. If your pitch deck is well done, it will filter out investors that are not a fit while simultaneously exciting those that are. These interested investors will need more information than what is in the pitch deck, which is why you need to prepare a Virtual Data Room (VDR).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>4.2 What to include in your Virtual Data Room (VDR)</strong></h4>\n      <p>\n          <a href="https://thevccorner.substack.com/p/running-a-fundraising-process-374">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   </body></html>	Raising venture capital is challenging, with only 1% of small businesses in the US being venture-backed.

We're a global community of founders and operators who've come together to support the next generation of builders. So the premise of the podcast is just that, founders interviewing other founders about the trials and tribulations of building a company. Hope you enjoy the episode.</p><p>00:00:21 Ari: Welcome everyone. My name is Ari Newman. I am an LP and a partner at Everywhere Ventures. I'm also the co-founder and managing director at Massive Capital Partners. We are a multi-stage venture firm that invests in deep tech, enterprise, and climate.</p><p>00:00:38 Ari: I was previously a founder and after 15 years on the operating side, joined the venture world and have been investing in amazing technologies and companies like Dapple ever since. So without further ado, I would love to introduce Gadalia. So excited to chat with you today. Please jump in, introduce yourself and we'll take it from there.</p><p>00:00:59 Gadalia: Thanks, Ari. Great to be here. So I'm Gadalia Montoya Weinberg-O'Bryan. I'm the founder and CEO of Dapple Security. We're a cybersecurity company protecting companies against phishing and ransomware by securing their workforce logins. And I've been in the security space my whole career.</p><p>00:01:17 Gadalia: I started out as a crypto mathematician at the NSA for about a decade and then transitioned to the private sector. And I helped lead one prior startup to exit. And now, yes, I'm proud to be part of the Everywhere portfolio.</p><p>00:01:30 Ari: Fantastic. So you're building a business called Dapple Security.</p><p>00:01:35 Gadalia: Yes.</p><p>00:01:36 Ari: Tell us more about the work and what the vision is for the company.</p><p>00:01:39 Gadalia: So I, as a cybersecurity practitioner, was really starting to get frustrated by continually seeing breaches and hacks start with the wrong person logging in. It really is the easiest way for hackers to get right in through the front door by tricking someone into giving up their login.</p><p>00:01:58 Gadalia:So being in that profession, it was the problem that I knew I wanted to address. And I realized I had something unique to bring to the space and that harkens back to my math background.</p><p>00:02:09 Gadalia: So we're really working on a next-gen MFA solution. So replacing those vulnerable password or traditional MFA logins with something that's using biometrics and phishing resistant and much more user-friendly.</p><p>00:02:25 Gadalia: The other thing I wanna emphasize is that we're really targeting the small and mid-size market first, which I think is not always the case for a lot of cybersecurity vendors, and that's a really underserved market. So that's a piece of what we're doing that I'm also really excited about in addition to the tech.</p><p>00:02:43 Ari: Super interesting. When you talk about MFA, maybe we can get further into the product conversation and also talk about the world of two-factor authentication and why SMS has got its issues because I'm sure folks would love to really understand why this is so critical.</p><p>00:02:57 Gadalia: Love to.</p><p>00:02:58 Ari: So based on your background and all the work that you've done prior, what compelled you to become a founder? And if you think back to your career, <em>like</em> what were some key moments that sort of got you to this point?</p><p>00:03:09 Gadalia: Honestly, it's surprising to think back on my career to find myself here because first and foremost, I was a mathematician and then I fell in love with security and I fancied myself a career government employee.</p><p>00:03:20 Gadalia: And then I made this huge leap to working at a<em> </em>startup that some colleagues from the NSA had founded<em> </em>and had me join really early on. And it was a surprise but a pleasant one to me that I really love operating and I really love building, like something that has continued as a thread through my career is building things from the ground up.</p><p>00:03:40 Gadalia: So I think I realized I am a natural founder at heart and that is where I belong. In terms of the problem space, I've been a witness to some pretty intense security breaches.</p><p>00:03:53 Gadalia: I was working at NSA when the Edward Snowden breaches occurred. I was a consultant at Merck Pharmaceuticals when they were hit by a ransomware attack in 2017 that brought their global operations down for weeks.</p><p>00:04:06 Gadalia: And it was shocking to me to see the impact of those, but also to think through what happens when a smaller organization experiences something like this? How would they weather, could they even weather?</p><p>00:04:18 Gadalia: So I think really having always been a mission-driven person at heart, that really brought me to, I think, the space of trying to tackle the fundamental problems that are facing businesses.</p><p>00:04:31 Ari: So one thing I wanted to ask you about, the security space is quite crowded. There's tons of vendors. And I think that's for good reason. There's a lot of problems and there's a lot of opportunity. Can we talk a little bit about what unique challenges and opportunities you see in your domain and security?</p><p>00:04:48 Gadalia: Yeah, like you said, there's so much to say. It's hard to know kind of where to start. But one thing I will say is, 90% of security breaches are starting with those stolen logins and things like phishing happening. And that leads to ransomware, it leads to wire fraud, it leads to data breaches.</p><p>00:05:06 Gadalia: And there are not solutions out there that are really targeting that small and mid-sized market first. And so I think I see that as a unique opportunity, as I kind of already mentioned, to offer an easier to adopt more affordable solution for businesses of all sizes.</p><p>00:05:22 Gadalia: Not to say we're excluding the enterprise, but really focusing on it being accessible. The other thing I'll say just in terms of challenges, because like you said, it is a crowded space.</p><p>00:05:31 Gadalia: One thing I do run into is that when we think about how we log into things in our personal lives and our work lives, big tech players really do control a lot of that. And they're not necessarily incentivized to accommodate innovation from smaller players or give users agency over their own data.</p><p>00:05:50 Gadalia: And so I do feel like as a company, I'm battling that on a daily basis in this space, but it feels to me like a challenge worth taking on.</p><p>00:06:00 Ari: Super interesting. I think there's two things there that really resonate with me personally is one, we all look for the low friction way to deal with login, which usually means the platform that you're on controls it.</p><p>00:06:12 Gadalia: Yep, I do. I do too. Yep.</p><p>00:06:15 Ari: Yep. And we have very little control. And especially when it comes to enterprise, that's extremely risky because we all get lazy. Okay, so now we're gonna play a game.</p><p>00:06:24 Gadalia: Okay.</p><p>00:06:24 Ari: I want you to finish the sentence for me.</p><p>00:06:26 Gadalia: Oh no!</p><p>00:06:27 Ari: When Dapple Security gets to scale, we will...?</p><p>00:06:31 Gadalia: We will have a fundamental impact on how digital identity is being handled on the internet.</p><p>00:06:40 Ari: Pretty profound opportunity in front of you.</p><p>00:06:42 Gadalia: It is.</p><p>00:06:43 Ari: Yeah, that's exciting. So as you work against that big giant goal, what stresses you out, what keeps you up at night? What do you sort of worry about getting in your way?</p><p>00:06:53 Gadalia: I'd say a couple of things. One I already mentioned, which is we are coming up against big players in the space who I think on the surface are trying to be more open and galvanize around standards to improve login experience and security for end users.</p><p>00:07:09 Gadalia: But as I said, are not necessarily incentivized in the same direction that businesses and consumers are. So that's one of them.</p><p>00:07:16 Gadalia: The other is our tech is based on some core technology that is inherently very difficult. It's based on some mathematical techniques that are not something we can just slap together and throw out there.</p><p>00:07:29 Gadalia: So we're always, as a company, straddling, iterating, and getting something out there and testing and having customers working with something while at the same time doing the R&amp;D to develop our core tech.</p><p>00:07:42 Ari: Interesting. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm trying to understand, your cryptography is unique in the market or is it stronger encryption than what is commonly used around login? Can you talk about that?</p><p>00:07:53 Gadalia: Yeah. Thanks for asking. It's nuanced, so I'll try to explain a bit more so that I'm not just dancing around it. What we're doing is you can think of it as replacing the traditional login with something passwordless. So we're starting with fingerprint.</p><p>00:08:07 Gadalia: So, okay, instead of entering username and password, I'm going to enter my username and then I can provide a fingerprint. The cool thing that we do that's different is that we can accomplish that without having to store the fingerprint anywhere and without having to store these credentials that are being passed back and forth behind the scenes anywhere.</p><p>00:08:28 Gadalia: And that brings a really nice user experience because if you think about the experience you have logging into your phone using maybe Face ID or a fingerprint on your laptop, it's trying to bring that same user experience to all of your logins<em><s> </s></em>having the same behavior as you're logging in across your different devices.</p><p>00:08:48 Gadalia: So there's a lot of magic that has to happen behind the scenes to accomplish that. And hopefully what the result is, is a delightful user experience and they shouldn't have to care that there's really fancy biometrics and cryptography happening behind the scenes. But it is something, like I said, that we have to battle through.</p><p>00:09:07 Ari: Right. And if you're not storing the fingerprint then it's much more difficult for that piece of data encrypted otherwise to be stolen and reused.</p><p>00:09:15 Gadalia: Yes. So I'll break something else down, just a couple of analogies. The basic way that most of our logins work today is based around something. I call it a shared secret. That's often what we in the industry talk about it as. And you can think of it as I know some secret, my password, or maybe my one-time code, and the server that I'm logging into knows the same secret.</p><p>00:09:37 Gadalia: And the way that they confirm it's me is by saying, oh yeah, the secrets match. But think of how easy it is to get in the middle of that transaction, to either trick me into telling you my secret or intercept those communications between me and the server and just relay things to pretend that you're the wrong user.</p><p>00:09:53 Gadalia: So we're basing our technology around a new set of standards. They're called the FIDO2 standards for anyone who wants to nerd out and care about it. And essentially that splits that paradigm in half so that you no longer have to have a shared secret. You can think of it as the server having a lock and the user having a key.</p><p>00:10:13 Gadalia: And as long as I have that correct key that fits the lock, I can get in, but I never have to tell anyone what my key is. And the lock can be public because it doesn't say anything about me. So we're essentially creating a lock out of the biometric itself.</p><p>00:10:29 Ari: I think it's important to talk about the details because your technology is unique and your approach is unique. And there's a reason that you've done this based on your past experience, which is really interesting.</p><p>00:10:38 Gadalia: Absolutely.</p><p>00:10:39 Ari: Changing gears a little bit. One of the things I know about you is that you're really passionate about increasing equity and representation in STEM fields. So I'm curious, what are some of the things that you see going on around STEM and equity? What are you passionate about there specifically? And what should your audience know about where to apply efforts or what's interesting?</p><p>00:11:01 Gadalia: I will be honest about the fact that probably half of the reason I became a founder was because I wanted to create a different kind of tech company, one that I hadn't worked for before, one that had a CEO that had looked different than what I'd worked for before.</p><p>00:11:15 Gadalia: So yeah, I do think part of my personal mission is not only to put great tech out there in the world and help our users, but also to just represent a tech company that, and show that not all tech companies have to look exactly the same in terms of their culture, in terms of who's leading them, in terms of who works there.</p><p>00:11:32 Gadalia: So I think in that representation is super important, always. And as a part of that, I try to always practice lift as I climb. And I love it when others do as well. If you have gotten to a point in your career where you can help others do so. And supporting all young people.</p><p>00:11:51 Gadalia: I have two teenagers and whenever their friends are over, I'm like, how's math going, how's science going, do you love it? You know, just trying to increase that curiosity and enthusiasm for all kids to think about entrepreneurship and STEM fields from a really young age. So those are the things that I really lean into personally.</p><p>00:12:09 Ari: Nice. That's fantastic. My son's interested in engineering and psyched about that also.</p><p>00:12:14 Gadalia: Yep. Like they may not be, right? But that's okay.</p><p>00:12:17 Ari: Right.</p><p>00:12:17 Gadalia: As long as they feel like that's an okay thing to be interested in and an option for them.</p><p>00:12:22 Ari: Yep. A curious mind is a good thing, right?</p><p>00:12:24 Gadalia: Absolutely. Yeah.</p><p>00:12:26 Ari: I'm sure that although the company is relatively young, you've already had some good wins and seen some positive impact of your technology. Do you have any particular, <em>like </em>case studies that you can mention or <em>sort of</em> moments where you got validation that you were really on the right path?</p><p>00:12:42 Gadalia: Yeah. And you're right, we are still early. We're still technically pre-product. We're working with some design partners who are early adopters and giving us feedback as we develop things. And one thing that really strikes me, for example, one of our design partners experienced a ransomware attack and it could have been very devastating for them.</p><p>00:13:03 Gadalia: So this is an opportunity for them to put something in place that is proactive from a cybersecurity perspective. So not just having to think about, okay, how do we react as quickly as we can when a ransomware attack is occurring and has breached our walls, but putting something in place that can prevent that from happening in the first place.</p><p>00:13:21 Gadalia: And if you think about it, that's the cheapest way for a business of any size to deal with a cyber attack is just for it not to happen. So seeing that, the comfort, I guess, that that gives them to know that they have something proactive they can put in place.</p><p>00:13:34 Gadalia: Reactive pieces of the system are also extremely important. You have to assume things will go wrong and defense in depth. But yeah, that's something that I really enjoy seeing. The last thing I guess I'll say there is this is a unique opportunity when security and user experience go hand in hand.</p><p>00:13:52 Gadalia: Those can often be competing priorities in an organization. So the fact that we're able to say, hey, yeah, this is a much more secure way of logging in to protect your business. But by the way, your users are really going to like it better than what they're doing right now. That feels pretty great.</p><p>00:14:08 Ari: That's important, right? A good low friction user experience drives greater adoption, which means more product success.</p><p>00:14:13 Gadalia: Yeah, it is first and foremost in terms of what we're trying to put out there.</p><p>00:14:17 Ari: That's fantastic. Let's talk about the future a little bit. So something I'm really curious to ask you about, given your math and cryptography and NSA background, is quantum.</p><p>00:14:27 Gadalia:<em> Ah.</em></p><p>00:14:27 Ari: Right? So the setup is the obvious thing, which is as the world approaches Q-Day, which is this moment where quantum computers become commercially viable to the point where they can be applied against what we currently use as modern encryption.</p><p>00:14:42 Ari: And it can beat encryption fast enough that it becomes a huge problem. Like everyone's paranoid. We're going to hit Q-Day and the entire world is going to melt. And the first thing people are going to apply quantum computers for are breaking things like SSL and 256 DES and all of the sort of robust security that we think we have today that's based on public-private key encryption.</p><p>00:15:04 Ari: What's your take on all of that? How big of a threat is it? What do you see happening in the security sector as these two traditional public-private key encryption technologies and quantum encryption or quantum computers <em>sort of</em> come to ahead?</p><p>00:15:18 Gadalia: Yeah. Call me a pragmatist. I'm not super worried about it. To me, it's an evolution of the same thing that has been happening already, which is that Moore's law means that our computers get faster all the time and have been over history.</p><p>00:15:32 Gadalia: And we have had to replace our cryptographic algorithms over time as that has happened. So we can rely on standards bodies like NIST who has provided guidance on which quantum resistant algorithms we should be using.</p><p>00:15:46 Gadalia: So I honestly think that we have practiced this before as an ecosystem and that if we just continue to learn from those exercises in the past and not put our heads in the sands and start to adopt those quantum resistant algorithms, but hopefully a lot of that can be done gradually so that it's a non issue.</p><p>00:16:07 Ari: Got it. So all these quantum companies that are telling us the world's going to melt the minute we hit this inflection plane, you say not so much.</p><p>00:16:15 Gadalia: Yeah, not so much. I mean, it's something to be aware of, like I said, and I'm glad that folks are out there that are working on technologies that will help us protect ourselves in that way. But to me, it just feels like an evolution of the fact that our computers have gotten increasingly better over time anyway.</p><p>00:16:31 Ari: Right, okay, I like the semi-contrarian view there. Do you have any other semi or totally contrarian views about the security sector as a whole that we should know about?</p><p>00:16:41 Gadalia: I don't know if it's so much contrarian as I have a little bit of a beef right now. As in cybersecurity or talking about multi-factor authentication or MFA. We've been beating this drum of MFA being so important for a while now, and I agree with that.</p><p>00:16:55 Gadalia: The problem is that we don't talk a lot about the fact that not all MFA is equal in terms of how it can protect us against phishing specifically. And most of the MFA that we're all currently using is very phishable.</p><p>00:17:08 Gadalia: And so I think my beef is that we talk about MFA as if it's this pangea of one thing when really there's a spectrum of different MFA solutions and they protect us differently end-to-end more or less.</p><p>00:17:23 Ari: I think you're being polite. And if I'm gonna say this back to you in a more direct way, if you think that your SMS-based MFA security is doing you any good, you're probably wrong.</p><p>00:17:35 Gadalia: Yes, and the crappy thing about it is that it's more of a pain to use and it's not helping us really at all. And so I think this was an example that I sent out in a recent investor update, but my bank recently started changing from using SMS because everyone's starting to understand that that's not very secure.</p><p>00:17:56 Gadalia: So now they insist on calling to give your one-time code, which isn't helping anything, but it is even more painful now to log in. So if you are using a multifactor authentication that is SMS, email-based, another one that folks feel is very secure are those one-time codes that you get using an authenticator app on your phone.</p><p>00:18:19 Gadalia: Same thing, it's still a shared secret. It is still a number that you know that the server knows that someone else can intercept. So yeah, unfortunately, even though they're a lot harder to use, they're really not protecting us any more than a simple password.</p><p>00:18:31 Ari: Yeah, my take is that the shared secret of a two-factor authentication app or generator is better than SMS because it's less vulnerable to SIM jacking, but only incrementally.</p><p>00:18:42 Gadalia: Yes, exactly. Yep. That's that spectrum that I was kind of talking about.</p><p>00:18:45 Ari: Got it. Okay, fantastic. Is there anything else that we should know about multi-factor authentication or about Dapple going forward?</p><p>00:18:56 Gadalia: I think one thing I'm really excited about is just that we have this chance or opportunity to fundamentally change the way that biometric data and cryptographic keys are handled on the internet. So I really love the solution that we're building today.</p><p>00:19:11 Gadalia: I think it has the potential to really help businesses of all sizes be more secure. But I also love the fact that this core technology is something that we can apply in a lot of different modalities going forward. So I would say this is only the beginning, I hope.</p><p>00:19:30 Ari: Do you feel sometimes in order for the enterprise, small business, like the business world, your customer base to understand how important your approach is.</p><p>00:19:40 Ari: Do we need some other high profile event, some situation where someone using an authenticator code gets a man in the middle attack and the whole company gets compromised and they thought they were secure only to then open the door to your narrative that a non-stored biometric object is the only way to solve that?</p><p>00:20:00 Ari: Are you waiting for your moment where all of the other stuff out there breaks and you're like, we're over here?</p><p>00:20:06 Gadalia: In some ways, yes. And there are some predictions that I made even a year ago that weren't sort of being understood by the market that even now are. And so it does feel somewhat satisfying to kind of look ahead and know that as more and more of these problems occur, that we have put something in place that is getting out ahead of that.</p><p>00:20:27 Gadalia: I will say though, that when we make a sale, it doesn't tend to be based on all of this fancy math that we talked about. It's really based around adoption, and affordability and user experience. The cool thing about what we're doing is that it makes all of those things better and cheaper and easier.</p><p>00:20:46 Gadalia: And by the way, there's some really cool stuff happening in the background that's privacy preserving and gives the enterprise and business more control over their employees' accounts and the end user more control, et cetera.</p><p>00:20:58 Gadalia: But I think, again, from a mission perspective, that's just satisfying for me to know is that we're taking this privacy first approach to everything we're doing. And we're not forcing our users to make that choice. We're saying we're giving you the best product we can. And oh, by the way, we are doing the right thing.</p><p>00:21:17 Ari: Right. Well, as a product nerd, I think that's super important. Great applications are kind of<em> </em>like icebergs. You should only really see what's above the waterline and that should be simple and beautiful. And there's a lot of complexity that nobody needs to see. It just needs to be done right. So...</p><p>00:21:31 Gadalia: Yeah, absolutely. Yep.</p><p>00:21:33 Ari: I think you're absolutely on the right path. That's fantastic. Let's change gears and jump into something we love to do called the speed round. So I'm gonna ask you a series of questions. You're gonna answer me stream of consciousness. You ready?</p><p>00:21:46 Gadalia: Okay, I'll try.</p><p>00:21:47 Ari: Okay. What's a current book that you're reading or a podcast that you're enjoying?</p><p>00:21:51 Gadalia: Okay. So from an industry perspective, I love Liminal State of Identity podcast. There's a Risky Business podcast as well. So those are two cybersecurity ones. From a business side, I love this podcast, Everywhere Ventures, great content.</p><p>00:22:08 Gadalia: And there's also a Practical Founders podcast that I really like because it offers some contrarian views on the space. And I'm going to say also just old-fashioned Denver Business Journal imprint on my kitchen counter. I love leafing through that and devour that every week.&nbsp;</p><p>00:22:25 Ari: That's great. Okay, if you could live anywhere in the world for one year, where would you go?</p><p>00:22:30 Gadalia: Probably Spain. I lived there as a kid. I haven't been back as an adult and I think that would be really cool to experience again, 40 years later.</p><p>00:22:40 Ari: Any city or area or just Spain period?</p><p>00:22:43 Gadalia: Oh, that's a good question. I lived in Zaragoza before, so maybe that one.</p><p>00:22:48 Ari: Okay, perfect. As a founder, what's your favorite productivity hack?</p><p>00:22:52 Gadalia: Okay, I'm saying this from a standpoint of a person who is horrible at calendars, but blocking time on my calendar to work on specific things. It's simple, but it really does do miracles for me.</p><p>00:23:04 Ari: Most importantly, where can people find you on the internet?</p><p>00:23:08 Gadalia: <em>Ah,</em> yes. Well, I'm always happy to receive inbound emails. So <a href="mailto:gadalia@dapplesecurity.com">gadalia@dapplesecurity.com</a>. Given my name, I'm also super easy to find on LinkedIn and I will respond to chats there as well. So either of those places.</p><p>00:23:22 Ari: Fantastic. Well, this has been super fun. Thank you so much for joining me for the conversation and wishing you and Dapple great success going forward. For the rest of you, thanks for tuning in today to the Everywhere podcast and have a great day.</p><p>00:23:37 Scott Harley: Thanks for joining us and hope you enjoyed today's episode.

Užėjęs į vieną barą bandžiau seną triuką, padedantį išvengti arbatpinigių. Po maisto pasakiau padavėjui:<br>– Labai geras aptarnavimas, bet neturiu grynų. Negaliu palikti arbatos.<br>– Tai pas mus jau galima kortele. Va, čia nuskanuokite šį barkodą ir palikite kiek norite.<br>Arbatpinigių pavyko išvengti pasakius, kad palikau mobilų telefoną namie. <br>– Bet jūs ką tik atsiskaitėte telefonu., – bandė kaulyti padavėjas.<br>– Čia mano darbinis. Su juo galiu tik už maistą mokėti, – nemirktelėjęs atsikirtau.</p><p>Situacija nebuvo labai maloni, tačiau nėra to blogo, kas neišeitų į gerą. Lengvas šokas pagimdė idėją – baruose slapta prikaišioti savo arbatpinigių kortelių, tačiau jos būtų su barkodais į mūsų banko sąskaitą. Sakau į mūsų, nes jau vertinu TAVE kaip savo verslo partnerį. Taigi ką aš siūlau:</p><p><strong>Programuotojai</strong><br>Jūs suprogramuojate mums tinkantį barkodą. Darbas neapmokamas, todėl kreipiuosi tik į profesionalus. Tikrai nenorėčiau, kad nemokamai nepatyręs programuotojas prie šio projekto gaištų savaitę nevalgęs. Kai tuo tarpu patyręs programuotojas viską lengvai padarytų tiesiog sėdėdamas ant tualeto. Patyręs programuotojau, vietoj skrolinimo ant tūliko, gali mums padėti.</p><p><strong>Grafikos dizaineriai</strong><br>Jums bus atsiųstos nuotraukos su barų arbatpinigių kortelių dizainu. Jums reikės atkartoti baro dizaino logotipą ir uždėti mūsų barkodą. Darbas nepamokamas, tačiau jeigu jums pavyks tiksliai atkartoti dizainą, tokiais darbais galėsite dalintis su klientais ir jie neatsispirs jūsų paslaugoms.</p><p><strong>Fotografijos studentai<br></strong>Šitas darbas neapmokamas, tačiau puiki progra pasipildyti portfolio. Jums reikia nufotografuoti baruose esančių kortelių dizainus. Kuo daugiau skirtingų dizainų nufotografuosite, tuo didesnis jūsų portfolio, tuo geresniais fotografais tapsite!</p><p><strong>Spaustuvės</strong><br>Jums lengviausia užduotis, reikia tiesiog NEMOKAMAI atspausdinti dizainus ant plastikinių kortelių. Tai nėra paprastas nemokamas užsakymas, tai investicija į Lietuvos ateitį. </p><p><strong>Logistikos praktikantai</strong><br>Norite dirbti logistikos įmonėse, tačiau neturite praktikos? Pas mus galite atlikti praktiką tai yra sudaryti kortelių išvežiojimo planus ir pasirūpinti, kad jos būtų pristatomos į atitinkamus barus.</p><p><strong>Logistikos praktikantų giminaičiai<br></strong>Niekas nenori turėti niekam tikusių bedarbių giminaičių. Todėl siūlome padėti, kad logistikoje planuojantys dirbti artimieji, pasiektų savo tikslų. Jie jums pateiktų barus, kuriuose turi būti kortelės. Jūs tas korteles paimtumėte iš spaustuvių. Žinoma, jūsų kvailiukai giminaičiai pridarys klaidų – būkite jiems atlaidūs. Patys atidžiai patikrinkite, ar kortelės logotipas atitinka baro logotipą, ar baro adresas geras ir panašiai. Padėkite giminaičiams! Už draugišką giminystę.</p><p><strong>Influenseriai</strong><br>Norite gauti didesnių užsakymų? Gaunate nusiskundimų, kad jūsų storiai tik reklama? Šis pasiūlymas kaip tik jums. Pasidalinkite įrašu, kuris skatintų žmones būti supratingais ir palikinėti daugiau arbatpinigių.  Kaip tai padarysite visiška jūsų laisvė. Žinoma, dėl bendro sutarimo prieš publikuodami visus storius atsiųskite man, kad galėčiau juos patikrinti. Storiai papostinti be mano sutikimo, bus traktuojami kaip idėjos vogimas.</p><p><strong>Aktyvistai</strong><br>Jums rūpi socialinė gerovė. Viskas ko reikia mieste pripaišyti juodų trafaretų su tekstu: Atriškite rankas padavėjams. Palikite arbatpinigių. Vergovei – NE!</p><p><strong>Programuotojai antra komanda</strong><br>Vėl reikia tik profesionalų. Naivūs vos sesiją baigiantys studentai – nesivarginkite. Darbas neapmokamas, bet kokybiškai neapmokamas. Mieli profesionalai, viskas ko reikėtų iš jūsų, suprogramuoti, kad dešimt procentų nuo gaunamų pajamų sugrįžtų padavėjams. <br>Tai yra aš nenoriu būti žūlikas ir pasiimti visų arbatpinigių. Be to, jei visi arbatpinigiai nusėstų pas mane – policija labai greitai pričiuptų. O jūs kaip ir bendrininkai, tai noriu apsaugoti ir jus.</p><p><strong>Nežinau kaip jūs įvardinti</strong><br>Žodžiu, jeigu jums buvo tokia problema, kad norėjote gauti paskolą, tačiau trūko pajamų. Šis pasiūlymas jums. Į jūsų sąskaitą suplauktų visi pinigai. Tada aš jums išrašau sąskaitą už stendupą ir pervedate visus pinigus man. Metų gale gautas pajamas deklaruojate ir taip keliate savo kreditingumą. Žinoma, mokesčių mokėjimas, pajamų pagrindimas – čia jau jūsų problema. Aš už jus visko negaliu padaryti.</p><p>Taigi toks mano verslo planas. Labai lauksiu norinčių prisidėti. Savaime suprantama, kadangi šis verslo planas laviruoja ant legalumo ribos, iškilus problemoms su teisėsauga, būčiau dėkingas jei mano vardo neminėtumėte.</p><p>Kadangi visi dirbsime nemokamai, tačiau valgyti reikia (nebent esate profesionalūs programuotojai daug pinigų gaunantys už nieką). Turiu jums draugišką patarimą – vokite iš savų. Geriausia iš labai artimų giminaičių ar draugų su kuriais labai gerai sutariate. Kuo geriau ir kuo ilgiau gerai sutariate tuo vėliau jie pastebės, kad vagiate iš jų. Jie paprasčiausiai atmes jūsų kandidatūrą į vagis. O kai pastebės bandys gražiai tartis, o ne iš karto kaip kokie šalti nepažįstami puls į policiją. </p><p>Kai draugai ar giminaičiai supras, kad tai jūsų darbeliai, nesiginčykite su jais. Linksėkite galvą ir planuokite vagystes iš kitų draugų. </p><p>Iki kito antradienio.</p><p>Gitarinių sentimentų ir skirtingų kartų bandymų susigaudyti pasaulyje, kai atrodo, kad nėra už ko nusitverti:</p><p>Laura Jane Grace - Walking Is Still Honest</p><div id="youtube2-k8_D34RCaQM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;k8_D34RCaQM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k8_D34RCaQM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>TV Smith - Generation Y </p><div id="youtube2-8OpVEBPayUY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;8OpVEBPayUY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8OpVEBPayUY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Dar pradėjau rašyti trumpus dalykėlius. Tokius:</p><p>***</p><p>Atsiprašau, gal galiu jus nufotografuoti? Klausiu taksisto, stovinčio prie Halės turgaus. Kodėl norit? Nu, nėra, kad kiekvieną dieną matyčiau mezgantį taksistą. O kam jums ta nuotrauka? Draugai nepatikės, jei foto nebus. Nenoriu būti jūsų eksponatu. Kodėl mezgate? Terapija po insulto. Atsiprašau. Nieko tokio viskas tik į gerą. O ką mezgate? Jūsų likimą. Kiek man liko? Keturi. Ko keturi? Keturi, trys, du, vienas. Nu, ir? Kas ir? Nesupratau,  ko man liko keturi. Banko sąskaitos likutį pasitikrink.</p><p>Pradedu tikrinti banko likutį. Sakau, tam durniui, kad niekas nepasikeitė. O tas taksioras prašo, kad galėtų mane nufotkinti. Klausiu, kodėl?</p><p>Noriu draugams parodyt. Nekiekvieną dieną sutinku žmonių, kurie tiki, kad taksistas po insulto su virbalais gali išmegzti banko sąskaitą.</p><p>***</p><p>Nešdamas šiukšles prie konteinerio sutikau buvusį grupioką. Apsikeitėm keliais  žodžiais. Kai neišmestas šiukšles bandžiau sukišti į prekybos centro šiukšlinę. Čia savo negalima. Gavau iš apsauginio. Negalima tai negalima. Eidamas toliau ir ieškodamas kito konteinerio galvojau apie kylančią ekonomiką, dirbtinį intelektą ir tai, kad būtent batai išdavė grupioką. Prakeikti batai. Tie nutrinti naikai, aptaškyti mėlynais grindų dažais ir kaimyno išmesti prieš porą dienų. Prakeikti batai. Kai prie picerijos apsauginių priėjo benamis ir pasiteiravo ar ten Daškė. Jam nueinant apsauginiai pastebėjo prabangius batus. Vėliau paaiškėjo, kad tai buvo ne benamis, o snaiperis, nušovęs Daškę. Prakeikti batai. New Yorke vyras, pardavinėjęs gatvėje eglutes pasakojo, kad prieš pasakydamas kainą žiūri į batus. Kartais eglutę dovanoju, kartais nuplešiu tiek kiek dovanų eglutę žmogus per savaitę išleidžia maistui. Prakeikti batai. Senelis vaikystėje pakliuvo į ligoninę, nes į mokyklą gruodžio mėnesį atėjo basas. Geriau basas nei klasiokų patyčios dėl klumpių. Dėl prakeiktų mėlynais dažais aptaškytų naikų, negalėjau išmesti šiukšlių. Nes maiše buvo vištiena, nuo kurios dieną prieš trims iš keturių mano svečių paleido vidurius. Nenorėjau, kad tą vištą valgytų grupiokas.</p><p>Norėjau tą vištą sušerti dėstytojai. Grupioko 4,65 balo suapvalinusiai iki 4. Ketvertą po kurio kitą kartą grupioką pamačiau prie konteinerio su prakeiktais mėlynais dažais aptaškytais naikais.</p><p>***</p><p>Vakar nesuveikė judesio lempa laiptinėje. Kaip greit savo orientacinį budrumą patikim davikliui iš Kinijos. Krisdamas spėjau pagalvoti.  Geriau vėliau negu niekada, suskambėjo kai su galvą trinktelėjus į radiatorių, kiniškas daviklis suveikė ir lempa užsidegė. Galiu pasakyti tik tiek, jei gyvenimas duoda močiutės kiaušinių - imkit juos nesivaržydami. Niekada nežinai, kada jie suveiks kaip oro pagalvė ir gulėdamas močiutės kiaušinių glitime džiaugsiesi, kad dėl jų telefono nesudaužei. Telefonas dar kartą krito ant žemės, kai pasilenkiau su skuduru valyti močiutės kiaušinių glitimo nuo grindų. Nepuoliau jo kelti. Mėgavausi Šriodingerio katės situacija. Kol nepakeltas telefonas, tol jis ir sudužęs, ir nesudužęs vienu metu. Kvantinė fizika buityje. O kažin kiek buities gali būti kvantinėje fizikoje? Atomai traukia ir stumia vieni kitus vienu metu. Neapsisprendę. Tikras buitekas. Telefonas  sudužo. Nu, bet visokių dienų yra. Visokių reikia. Bet negirt dienos be vakaro tas pats, kas negirt gyvenimo kol neišeini į pensiją. Liaudies išmintis pagyrimo raštais nesisklaido. Todėl kartais pasakau “op” ir per griovį nebešoku. Nes mano griovys aukščiau bambos. Aš nežinau, kas čia buvo, bet jei gyvenimas duoda močiutės kiaušinių – imkit, nes gal juos valgydami sukursit išgalvotą postą apie nesuveikusį judesio daviklį.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://domasraibys.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://domasraibys.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p></p></body></html>	Verslo planas siūlo slaptai keisti barų arbatpinigių korteles į savas, nukreipiant pinigus į savo sąskaitą.

Nes negali būti nieko baisiau kai sau ramiai skrolini feisbuke ir kas nors skambina darbo reikalais:</p><p>– Klausau.</p><p>– Čia dėl to stendapo. Turėjote praeitą savaitę pasirodyti, o dar nepasirodote.</p><p>– Žinokit, aš vis dar labai užsiėmęs.</p><p>– Bet mes čia su įmone jau antra savaitė laukiame.</p><p>– Priminkite, kur ir kiek laiko jūs manęs laukiate?</p><p>– Biržų aktų salė. Trečia savaitė. </p><p>– Bet čia juk viena geriausių aktų salių. Laukiamajame net karšto šokolado yra. Dabar negaliu. Gal kitą savaitę.</p><p>– Tai mums dar ir kitą savaitę imti neapmokamų atostogų?</p><p>– Taip, jei nenorite pravaikštų.</p><p>Trumpi skambučiai, bet vis tiek išmuša iš vėžių. Todėl dažnai sėdžiu skrolinu naktį. Taip buvo ir praeitą naktį skrolinu. Ir girdžiu kažkas traška. Atsisuku. Aišku už nugaro nieko nėra. Bet ir garsas nutyla. Toliau skrolinu. Ir vėl girdžiu, toks lyg tarškėjimas. Kurį laiką mintis, kad čia mano biologinis laikrodis taip nuo bėgimo išdžiūvo ir tiksi. Vos nepradėjau gūglinti “how to oil your biological clock”.</p><p>Vėl žiūriu už nugaros. Ten vienintelis galimas garso šaltinis – gėlė. Prieš akis pradeda bėgti tie visi timelepsai, kur pagreitintai auga gėlės. Pradėjau galvoti, kad girdžiu kaip auga gėlė. Kyla unikali mintis – įrašyti gėlės augimo garsą. Bet vos prieinu prie tos gėlės ji lyg ir nutyla. Pradėjau galvoti gal aš gėlei šviesą užstoju ir ji nebegali augti. Bet kokia šviesa naktį? Ir netyčia mano žvilgsnis nukrypsta į malkas šalia židinio. Ir suvokiu, kad tas garsas sklinda, greičiausiai, iš malkuose esančių kirvarpų. </p><p>Tada pradedu galvoti, kad tie vargšai Biržų aktų salėje tarška kaip tos kirvapos. Trina salės kėdes, parketą, dėvi vandentiekio sistemą. Biržų aktų salė yra kaip negalintis apsiginti medžio gabalas, taršomas kirvarpų. Net baisu įsivaizduoti, kokių nuobodybių turi klausytis aktų salės sienos. Nedelsiant skambinu į Biržus:</p><p>– Alio.– apsimiegojęs balsas.</p><p>– Ruoškitės stendapui. Tuoj būsiu.</p><p>Čia naujas klumpių video. Iki bėgimo liko mažiau nei dvi savaitės:</p><div id="youtube2-8O3ozQ0k6TI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;8O3ozQ0k6TI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8O3ozQ0k6TI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>O čia dar keletas trumpų istorijų:</p><p>Nežinau ar teisinga nuteisti žmones, išimant vieną negražų segmentą iš jų gyvenimo. Spręsti jums. Vakar naktį mačiau kaip mano kaimynas, lėkdamas su mašina, aptaškė du praeivius. Labai sunervino. Priėjau prie tų dviejų bičų. Baisūs tokie. Pasakiau, kad žinau, kur jo mašina stovi. Pasiūliau. Visiškai ant bajerio. Palaukti ir su raktu subraižyti. Ant bajerio. O tie rimtai priėmė. Taip entuziastingai, kad aš jau negalėjau gaidintis ir neberodyti mašinos. Nueinam į mano kiemą. Matom mašiną. Tie pradeda mėtytis. Aš vėl ant bajerio jiems pasakau, kad jau tamsu ir kamerų pas mus nėra. Išsitraukiam raktus. Aš tai ant bajerio. Nesitikėjau, kad tie braižys. Jiems braižant, o man tupint iš kitos pusės. Mašina atsirakina ir užsidega šviesos. Kaimynas kažką paliko mašinoje. Tie bėgti prie vartų. Vargšai nerado mygtuko. Mašiną su raktu braižyti nagli, bet kai reikia galvą naudoti, nebeišeina. Kaimynas iškvietė policiją. Aš, prisidengęs tamsa, įsliūkinau į savo laiptinę. Grįžau pasimetęs. Nusliūkindamas girdėjau kaip jie visi trys gražiai kalbėjosi. Tipo visi nekalti. Avinėliai. Nors gal be reikalo aš juos teisiu. Nors manęs tai jau neliečia, dabar greitai temsta, rekomenduoju užsidėti atšvaistą, kad kaimynas laiku pamatytų ir nereikėtų staigiai į balas sukti ir taip aptaškyti kitus žmones.</p><p>***</p><p>Traukiny moteris per telefoną klausosi muzikos. Priešais sėdintis vyras, mandagiai pasiūlo paskolinti ausines. Moteris nesupranta. Atsako, kad ausinių nenaudoja. Mes visi girdime, kad nenaudojate. Bet kodėl nenaudojate? Šypsosi vyras. Nes jeigu šitą šūdiną muziką pasileisčiau per ausines man pradėtų kraujuoti ausų bugneliai. Tai, kodėl jos klausotės? Man feisbukas nesiūlo kitos. Vyras atsistoja ir surėkia. Mes visi galime jums padėti! Ar ne taip? Troleibuse kyla sambrūzdis. Dabar taip. Aš paimu iš šitos moters telefoną, o jūs jos feisbuke palaikinate savo mėgstamą atlikėją. Moteris kažką bando sakyti. Nusiraminkite. Aš profesionalas. Mes sugriausime jūsų algoritmus. Po dešimties minučių troleibuse tyla. Moteris klausosi muzikos su ausinėmis. Prie vyro prieina kitas vyriškis:</p><p>– O gal žinote, kaip ant dujinės nustatyti laikrodį? Niekaip nepavyksta.</p><p>***</p><p>Apsipirkinėju savitarnoje. Girdžiu kaip apsauginis rėkia ant paauglio. Kiek tu čia laiko stovėsi? Krauk greičiau savo tuos čipsus ir eik lauk. Nesikišu. Aš internete sąskaitas suvedinėju. Vieni kviečia į lauką išeiti pakalbėti. Aš kviečiu į internetą. Ateisi į internetą – tau šakės. Penkias valandas tavo laiko sudaužysiu kaip uogą. Komentarai yra mano ringas. Laiko nokdaunas. Supratot. Paauglys kažką pabamba ir išeina. Pažiūriu į apsauginį ir suprantu, kad nėra šansų, kad jis ateis pas mane į komentarus. Nusprendžiu pasiteirauti. Atsiprašau, o kiek laiko turiu prie savitarnos? Šypsosi jis man. Taigi suaugęs žmogus esi. Nesupratau, o ką tai bendro turi stovėjimu prie kasos? Dabar juk prakaitavimo metas. Nesvarbu ar su striuke ar su megztiniu išeisi į lauka – suprakaituosi. Tie paaugliai iš mokyklos atbėga į parduotuvę ir dar labiau suprakaitavę išbėga į lauką. Ir paskui peršąla. Snargliuojasi. Bandžiau jiems draugiškai paaiškinti. Be šansų. Tai reikia parėkti. Išėjau nieko nepasakęs. Tik namie atsidaręs feisbuką prie draugų pasiūlymų radau apsauginį. Nekviesiu. Tegul saugo paauglius. Linkiu nesusirgti.</p></body></html>	Naktinis darbas be trikdžių.

Paskui dar 4 kartus ėjau pati viena, vienuolikmetė, žiūrėti to didingo ir ašaringo reginio, dar kokius 10kart vėliau žliumbiau žiūrėdama per TV, tebeturiu storą papkę su iškarpom iš laikraščių, nes anuomet niekas netingėjo rašyti apie DiCaprio ir apie populiariausią visų laikų (iki tol) filmą.</p><p><a href="https://titanic.pl/">Parodos Varšuvoje</a> (veiks iki metų galo) atsiliepimai vidutiniški, manau, dėl to, kad daug kas tikėjosi parodos apie DiCaprio. Kiti gal manė pamatysiantys išskirtinę laivo prabangą ir auksines suknias. Bet paroda rimta, tikėjausi paskutinės salės, skirtos reprezentacijai filmuose ir kt., bet net tokio pataikavimo nebuvo.

Už ~30 eur išklausiau 7 labai skirtingų koncertų. Nostalgiškai prisiminiau prieš 15 m. Lenkų kultūros namuose (Vilniuje) vykdavusius <a href="https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.LT">apdovanojimus A.LT</a>, kur vienoje scenoje pasirodydavo visų ne-pop stilių muzikos atstovai. Varšuvoje taip pat buvo įdomu stebėti publiką, atstovaujančią visoms tebeegzistuojančios ir nykstančioms subkultūroms, nuo senų reiverių iki jaunų metalistų, bei tiesiog paprastam visavalgiam žmogui kaip aš.</p><p>Taip pat galvojau apie tai, kad pas mus avangardas suprantama kaip kažkas labai rimto, avangardinė muzika skamba kokiam nors ŠMC, „Jaunos muzikos“ festivalyje ar bent jau „Vilnius Jazz“. Lenkiškasis renginio konceptas buvo be jokio elitizmo, koncertai vyko toliau nuo centro, industriniuose klubuose/baruose/skylėse.

Atlikėja su zombio linzėm vaikščiojo tarp publikos ir prikišdama arti veidą gąsdino vyrus (kažkodėl jų publikoj buvo daugiau). Visgi saugi performanso riba nebuvo peržengta, visi liko pakutenti, su nejaukiom šypsenėlėm, buvo daug ką pafilmuoti, bet muzikinio ir idėjinio turinio lyg ir neįžvelgiau.

Koncerte buvo galima įsitikinti tiesa, kad gamtoje nėra garsiau klykiančio gyvūno už paauglę mergaitę. Stereotipiškai atrodantys vyrai čia buvo nebent tėčiai arba apsauginiai. Tikrai keistas pojūtis būti minioj, kurioj visi ne aukštesni už mane.</p><p>Marie sirgo, sakė: „Šiandien dar su niekuo nekalbėjau, saugojau balsą, jūs pirmi, tai girdėsit daug nesąmonių.“ Atliko Billie Eilish dainos fragmentą su žodžiais <em>miau miau miaaauu</em>. Vieną kūrinį dedikavo „lenkiškai virtuvei“. O savo žavinga laisva laikysena scenoje priminė mūsiškę Beatrich ar mažutę mielą Courtney Love. Buvo atliktas ir publikos praskyrimo stebuklas (žr. klipą), kai Marie atsiduria minios epicentre.

Graphs. Lambo photos. Banking stories. Such a huge snoozer. Whenever people ask me what books to read about money it’s hard. But one book I read in the last 24 months blew my mind:</p><p><em>“How To Live”</em> by Derek Sivers. It doesn’t seem like a book about money but it is.</p><p>Here’s what you can learn from it.</p><h1><strong>The biggest money lesson from </strong><em>“How To Live”</em></h1><p>I always hated when people made lots of money.</p><p>I loved to throw mud at billionaires while sipping a one-dollar 7-Eleven coffee. Then Derek Sivers said this:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Making money is nothing more than a neutral exchange of value. Making money is proof you're adding value to people's lives. Aiming to get rich is aiming to be useful to the world."</em></p></blockquote><p>Making money is helping people.</p><p>When someone makes a lot of money it means they’ve helped a lot of people, and you should at least shake their hand. You should probably also try to learn something from them. Only closed-minded losers shame wealthy people.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>"Making money isn't evil, greedy, shallow, or vain. Your biggest obstacle to getting rich is the harmful meaning you've attached to it."</p></div><h1>Money doesn’t give a f*ck about these things…</h1><blockquote><p><em>"Money doesn't care about your:</em></p><p><em>• Race</em></p><p><em>• Gender</em></p><p><em>• Education</em></p><p><em>• Physique</em></p><p><em>• Family</em></p><p><em>• Nationality</em></p><p><em>Anyone can be rich – so it might as well be you."</em></p></blockquote><p>I suspect this one will blow up a few people’s brains.</p><p>We’re taught by society to be victims. To blame our money problems on a 3rd party or even politicians. But no president is going to save you or your bank account. They’re busy building theirs and enjoying their newfound status.</p><p>One of my good friends makes 7-figures (USD) a year. He comes from a poor village in Africa. He decided to change his family’s future.</p><p>The only thing stopping you getting wealthy are your bullsh*t excuses about why it can’t happen. Money has nothing to do with IQ, and everything to do with helpfulness.</p><h1>“If more information was the answer, we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs.”</h1><p>Most people drown in information. They think the information age is the future.</p><p>Wrong. It’s the past. AI screwed the information age in the butt. We’re now drowning in information. Amazon is filled with AI-written books. Social media has AI sludge all over it. Our email inboxes are the next target for AI.</p><p>What a lot of people are missing is more action.</p><p>Taking what you’ve already learned and putting it to good use. Consuming more information is often nothing more than procrastination in disguise. It’s why my academy now offers execution instead of information.</p><p>Get around other people with the same goal. Take daily action.</p><h1>"Ideas are worth almost nothing.</h1><h1>Execution is everything. The world is filled with ideas, yet so few take action and make them happen."</h1><p>I met someone recently who had an idea for an AI marketplace.</p><p>They didn’t want to talk about it. They wanted me to sign an NDA. I told them “no one gives a f*ck about another AI chatbot idea. There’s nothing unique here, just like Uber but for boats isn’t a genius idea (a bank customer once wanted me to sign an NDA over this idea, too…LOL).</p><p>Investors and banks don’t invest in ideas. They invest in execution.</p><p>Do you have any results? Do you have customers? Have you earned any money from it? That’s the hard part.</p><p>We don’t value Elon Musk because he had a great idea of sending rockets to Mars. We value him because he sent rockets to space and saved real astronauts who were stranded.</p><p>Become an action-taker to get wealthy. Throw your ideas in the bin. What I learned is that dumb ideas often make the most money – life is a paradox.</p><h1>“The purpose of <strong>money</strong> is to trade for things that make you happy.</h1><h1>So if you can bypass <strong>money</strong> and get directly to the happy, you've saved a lot of trouble.”</h1><p>Not needing stuff is a huge money hack.</p><p>My Honda Civic is 9 years old. She still drives like a dream. I could easily replace it with a Lambo 4WD tomorrow. Yet I don’t. I don’t need another car. I have zero desire for material possessions or status. So I don’t need to earn as much money to live, which means my freedom number is 10x lower than the average person.</p><p>It also means I can retire decades earlier than most corporate rats.</p><p>What I chase is happiness. My 1 year old daughter gives me all of that for the cost of new nappies and some Bluey books with the occasional cafe smoothie.</p><p>Money can make your life complicated or simple. Choose simple.</p><h1><strong>“We do so many things for money whether we need it or not”</strong></h1><p>The virtue-signalling unicorns in the West love to pretend they don’t work for money.</p><p>They think they’re too good for money. They’re special. They’re driven by purpose. They’re writing the novel for the love of it. They would never dare ‘monetize’ a hobby. How dare you!</p><p>I call bullsh*t.</p><p>We do things for money even if we don’t need money. Getting paid helps us feel like we’re not being exploited. Better yet…</p><pre><code>Money helps make our work better.</code></pre><p>When you get paid you can build a website, hire a virtual assistant, get a fancy book cover designed by a cartoonist, and buy software to make your productivity higher.</p><p>Never trust a person who says they don’t need money.</p><h1>"Making money is a skill. Learn it and practice it like you would any other."</h1><p>Some people spend their entire lives struggling with money.</p><p>I was that person too. What changed for me was when I realized making money is a skill. There’s an art to crafting offers, sending proposals, pricing your time, and gently persuading someone to get your help.</p><p>Instead of treating money as this mysterious thing you never have enough of, turn it into an art form with a set of skills attached that you can learn.</p><h1>"Don't buy too many things, too big of a house, or hire too many people.</h1><h1>Rich people who do this feel trapped and miserable. The less you buy, the more you're in control."</h1><p>As your wealth increases it’s tempting to buy more stuff.</p><p>I’m a fan of hiring people to get more of your time back and build leverage, but there’s a threshold where a team of people can become a huge burden.</p><p>Material possessions require maintenance. That needs more money. And every item occupies some mental bandwidth.</p><p>The less stuff you own, the less your stuff owns you.</p><h1>"The more something costs, the more people value it.</h1><h1>By charging more, you're actually helping them use it and appreciate it."</h1><p>How you price your products and services is psychological, too.</p><p>Some people accidentally accept a low salary because they don’t know their own value. They think they have to be the lowest-cost option to get the job.</p><p>What I found when I applied for new jobs is the higher I told them my expected salary was the more seriously they wanted to hire me. A $300K a year salesperson sounds like they’d be better than a $50K a year one.</p><p>The same applies to business. I ran a $10K service and felt guilty for the high price tag. But the customers loved it because the cost forced them to take action and get results in 30 days.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>"Charge more than is comfortable to your current self-image. Value yourself higher, then rise to fit this valuation."</p></div><h1>"To get rich, don't think about what's valuable to you. Think about what's valuable to others."</h1><p>Selfish people are broke.</p><p>When it comes to making money they always think about their selfish desires and wants. They never think about how they can be helpful. This selfishness is a disease. It comes from the current <em>me, me, me</em> culture.</p><pre><code>Harsh truth: nobody gives a f*ck about you and what you want in life.</code></pre><p>We’re all thinking about ourselves. So put others ahead and you’ll be an uncommon mofo who’ll make more money than feels humanly possible. I never try to guess what is valuable in my business. I ask people. I survey them. I have Zoom calls with them.</p><p>Selflessness will make you wealthy.</p><h1>“Emotions are the enemy of good investing."</h1><p>The dumbest people I’ve ever met are day traders.</p><p>They don’t understand that it’s just gambling with a s*xier label. They often trade stocks, FX or crypto and even do courses to learn this magical skill.</p><p>Anyone who has worked in finance knows that buying &amp; selling any investment in the short term is gambling.</p><p>What screws day traders are their emotions.</p><p>It’s a constant high and low rollercoaster. Ultimately they lose every dollar… or they win the jackpot by accident and gamble it all back. Stay away from emotion-driven, short-term investing.</p><h1>“The world is full of money. There's no shortage. So capture the value you create. Charge for what you do."</h1><p>Money used to be scarce.</p><p>You were born in a country and the opportunities there defined your financial potential. If you grew up in a poor place you had to migrate to somewhere like America. It was complicated, expensive, and came with a waiting list.</p><p>Since the internet took over the planet everything has changed. It’s a borderless, global marketplace that’s open 24/7. We’re no longer limited by anything. And there are billions of dollars on the internet every day that are accessible to you.</p><p>The only limitation is whether you can attract that money to your life. That starts with ethically gaining some attention on social media, and choosing a half-decent business model.</p><p>The last one is key. Many people choose Uber slave driver income streams, like freelancing marketplaces, then wonder why their life turns to cr*ap.</p><p>Gain attention. Choose a digital income stream that’s proven to make cash. Then tell your old 9-5 boss to stick their job where the sun don’t shine (proud to have done this).</p><h1>"The world needs more boldness.</h1><h1>Refuse the comfortable addiction of a steady paycheck."</h1><p>The comfortable life is a nightmare.</p><p>It leads to mediocrity that pays the worst. You face high competition and the constant threat of the layoff boogie monster that’ll bite your titties off.</p><p>I have no problem with people starting with a paycheck. What’s sad is when it ends there. The bold thing to do is go out on your own and have multiple employers (customers). It forces you to stay sharp and add value. You can’t get lost in a big organization or hide behind a department for cover and free pizza.</p><p>Since I quit my job in 2021 my skills have increased by at least 100x. I’ve spent wild amounts of money on coaching, masterminds, courses, and events that have helped me gain new micro skills.</p><p>In banking, my only skill was order-taking (sales) and perhaps sending a few emails to customers with transaction fees on them.</p><p>Choose the path of growth and discomfort if you want to be wealthy.</p><h1>"Nothing destroys money faster than seeking status."</h1><p>I met a guy a few months back. Nice fellow. I wrote about him in another Substack.</p><p>He bought a BMW. He felt incredible. But the status cost him $3000 a month plus 15% a year in interest on the loan. If he invested that money in a business he would probably have quit his job by now.</p><p>When he handed over the cash to the German car company, everything at work was great. Now it isn’t. A new boss started. They micro-manage him. They took away his 6-figure bonus. Chasing status is stupid. The richest people look ordinary.</p><p>Real status is the free time to do whatever the F you want.</p><h1><strong>Closing Thought</strong></h1><p>I strongly recommend you read “How To Live.” It will change your financial life.</p><p>What’s your favorite money idea above from Derek?</p><p><em>This article is for informational purposes only, it should not be considered financial, tax or legal advice.

The answer is very specific to the type of company, the founders, and the challenge that the business needs to overcome. One possible answer is that the board is the only place where founders can navigate the inherent complexity of building a startup. They do so by having an ongoing discussion with involved people that share incentives but are not fully immersed in the day-to-day operations. As humans, we create reality by sharing with others, hence the board is a way of creating reality. If this perspective seems too abstract, consider this: the board is the place where founders can work on the company instead of in the company. It’s an opportunity to take a step back and look at the bigger picture once a quarter, gaining a sense of accomplishment and future direction. And it is a Board Member’s opportunity to provide this perspective.</p><h3><strong>Fiduciary Duties: The Cornerstone of Effective Governance<br></strong></h3><p>At the heart of a board director’s role are fiduciary duties, which serve as the bedrock of trust and integrity within the boardroom. These duties are not just ethical guidelines – they are legal obligations that require directors to prioritize the company’s interests above all else. Here we will get you familiar with the two most important fiduciary duties* – the duty of Care and the duty of Loyalty.</p><p><em>*A fiduciary duty is the legal responsibility to act solely in the best interest of another party. “Fiduciary” means trust, and a person with a fiduciary duty has a legal obligation to maintain that trust.</em></p><ol><li><p><strong>Duty of Care: Informed Decision-Making</strong></p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Directors must make well-informed decisions by thoroughly understanding all relevant information.</p></li><li><p>Reliance on expert advice is permitted, but it must be reasonable and made in good faith.</p></li><li><p>Active participation in board deliberations is required, with delegation limited to specific decision-making responsibilities.</p></li></ul><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Duty of Loyalty: Prioritizing the Company’s Interests</strong></p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Directors must act in the company’s best interests, avoiding conflicts of interest and refraining from using their position for personal gain.</p></li><li><p>This duty underscores the importance of integrity and ethical behavior in board decisions.</p></li><li><p>The Duty of Loyalty also extends to safeguarding the company’s confidential information. Directors must ensure that sensitive data is not misused or disclosed inappropriately, as this could harm the company’s competitive position.</p></li></ul><p>Beyond these, directors are also bound by the duties of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Obedience</strong> – directors abide by all applicable laws and regulations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> – directors keep certain type of information confidential.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prudence</strong> – be aware of risks and exercise caution when making decisions; approve expenditures wisely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disclose</strong> – if directors have information that would influence their decisions or impact the decisions of other board members, they have a duty to make that information known.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Navigating Conflicts of Interest: A Delicate Balance</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, life is always messier. Although the above principles are universally accepted, most board directors serve different “masters” in their heads. VCs representatives prioritize their VC fund, co-founders might focus on their team or their customers, and so on. Many heated discussions and conflicts on boards arise because directors have different priorities, even though everyone assumes they are acting in the best long-term interests of the company.</p><p>To manage these conflicts effectively, directors must engage in open, honest communication. The board should establish clear guidelines for identifying and managing conflicts of interest, ensuring that all directors understand their responsibilities in this area. When conflicts arise, it’s important to address them head-on, fostering an environment where differing viewpoints can be discussed openly and resolved in a way that aligns with the company’s long-term goals.</p><h3><strong>The Role and Responsibilities of the Board: Governance in Action</strong></h3><p>The board’s role extends beyond mere oversight. While the board does not involve itself in day-to-day operations, it plays a crucial role in setting the strategic direction of the company. This responsibility is encapsulated in the principle of “Nose in, hands out,” which suggests that while the board should be deeply informed about the company’s activities, it should refrain from micromanaging.</p><p>Key responsibilities of the board include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Strategic Oversight</strong>: The board is responsible for guiding the company’s long-term strategy. This involves reviewing and approving major initiatives, such as market expansion, product development, and mergers or acquisitions. Directors should ensure that the company’s strategy is aligned with its mission and values and that it is adaptable to changing market conditions.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>CEO and Executive Management Oversight</strong>: One of the board’s most critical functions is the selection, evaluation, and, if necessary, replacement of the CEO. The board must also set appropriate compensation for the CEO and senior management, aligning incentives with the company’s performance and long-term goals. Regular performance reviews help ensure that the CEO and management team are executing the board’s strategic vision effectively.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Risk Management</strong>:&nbsp;The board must oversee the company’s risk management framework, ensuring that all potential risks—financial, operational, legal, and reputational—are identified and mitigated. Directors should ensure that the company has adequate insurance, internal controls, and crisis management plans in place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compliance and Ethical Oversight</strong>: Directors are responsible for ensuring that the company adheres to all relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards. This includes setting policies on issues like environmental impact, social responsibility, and corporate governance.<br></p></li></ol><h3><strong>The Path to Effective Board Governance</strong></h3><p>Board governance is not just about ticking boxes; it’s about creating value for the company and its stakeholders. By understanding and embracing their fiduciary duties, board directors can build a foundation of trust, integrity, and strategic foresight that drives the company towards sustainable success. Effective governance requires a delicate balance of oversight and empowerment, where directors guide the company’s vision while enabling the management team to execute it.</p><p>As a board director, your role is to ensure that every decision contributes to the long-term prosperity of the company. By fostering transparency, managing conflicts of interest, and staying committed to your fiduciary duties, you can help steer the company through the complexities of growth and innovation, ensuring that it not only survives but thrives in a competitive landscape.</p><p>Coming up next – strategic planning and execution oversight. </p><p>Stay tuned for Chapter 2!</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" width="1100" height="220" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Wanna be featured on eu.vc?

Tiek vargšas Džiovanis keiksnojamas, kad man jau net norisi protestuot, priešintis inercijai ir sakyt, kad nugi nieko jis blogo nedaro. Tokias mintis sustiprino <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV9c7YZJeeI&amp;t=4371s&amp;ab_channel=Lietuvosnacionalinisradijasirtelevizija">Zilnio pokalbis su Nainiu</a>, kur šis savo firminiu itin ramiu ir mandagiu tonu gana blaiviai vertina savo kūrybą ir kitų požiūrį į ją. Įspūdingiausia, kai savo kūrybą palygina su greito maisto restoranu. Taip pat keliskart kartoja, kad „savo temoj, tiems žmonėms, kuriems aš groju, aš tikrai moku padaryt gerą laiką“, „daug darbo įdedu, kad žmonės gautų šventę“.</p><p>Kiek tragikomiškiau skamba pasakojimas apie Jovanio apsilankymą Opiume, kai kažkas jį pasiuntė nx („nors man gi gali visokia muzika patikt“), ir jo atsakas kritikams: „Kaip aš galiu nemokėt grot, jei tą esu daręs jau tūkstančius valandų.“ Na, čia iškyla terminologinis klausimas – ką vadinsime grojimu. Ar melodijos atitaikymą prie vizulkių ekrane galime vadinti grojimu? Slidi ta riba, tarp elektroninės muzikos kūrybos, senų pamirštų kūrinių remiksavimo, prikėlimo naujam gyvenimui, ir – naudojimosi kitų kūryba savo materialinio pralobimo tikslais.</p><p>Ta riba slidinėja ir Jovani savo albume, kuris man turbūt labiausiai nepatinka tuo, kad Jovani vardas rašomas pirmiau originalaus kūrinio atlikėjų. Juk jeigu būtų užrašyta Jurga „Nebijok“ (Jovani remix), viskas būtų kaip ir aišku ir neįdomu. </p><p>Tokio albumo, kuriame patiuninguotos senos (pagyvenusios) lietuviškos dainos, motyvaciją Jovanis aiškina tuo, kad lietuviška muzika atgimė, vėl tapo įdomi, seni gabalai buvo įrašyti labai prasta kokybe, norisi, kad jie „skambėtų šiuolaikiškai“. Čia vėl terminologinis klausimas - kas tas šiuolaikiškai? Bet suprantu, kad didelei daliai žmonių patinka mašinoj įsijungt gerą ritmuką. Be to, kaip pasakoja Nainys, visiems šiems autoriams buvo paskambinta, visi jie sutiko bendradarbiauti ir galimai netgi pasirodys Jovani Arena Show. Tikrai galiu sutikt dėl prastos Junior ar Ledi Ais įrašų kokybės. Tos dainos tikrai nusipelno ir antro, ir trečio gyvenimo. Bet ar tas pats galioja Jurgai ir Lemon Joy? Taip pat kažkaip nemalonu matyti, kad šitie Jovanio remiksai dabar perklausomis prilygsta arba lenkia originalus.</p><p>Taip pat nuvilia, kad albume net trys Junior gabalai – turbūt su jais geriausiai pavyko suvaibint. Bet jei jau daroma tokia lietuviško pop kompiliacija, norėtųsi jos įvairesnės. Kur Ekspreso „Pirmoji naktis“? Kur Dinamika? </p><p>Prasmingiausiai, žinoma, skamba du gabalai su Remio Retro repu, nes nuo remikso priartėja prie koverio.

Ne vienus metus esu ten save edukavus, nes programoje visada galima rasti ir ausų nelaužančio klasikinio džiazo, ir beprotiško avangardo, ir Lietuvos džiazo istorijos, ir naujokų, ir tolimų, ir artimų kraštų. Tai ten siūlau eiti.</p><p>O taipogi siūlau susipažinti su Lietuvos muzikos informacijos centro atrinktais pastarųjų poros metų įdomiausiais džiazo kūriniais. Rinktinė sumanyta skatinti muzikos sklaidai užsienyje, bet tikrai turėtų būti labiau pasitelkiama ir sklaidai Lietuvoje. Rinktinė įvairiažanrė, įvairiastilė ir įvairiainstrumentė, nuo mylimų Sheep Got Waxed iki didelių tarptautinių ansamblių.</p><p>Apskritai Note Lithuania rinkiniai man atrodo neįkainojamos vertės. (Dalį jų galite rasti <a href="https://www.mic.lt/lt/grotuvas/">MIC grotuve</a>. O visą krūvą seniausių, nuo 2007 m., <a href="https://www.pakartot.lt/project/note-lithuania">rasite Pakartot</a>. Labai norėtųsi, kad jie visi taptų patogiai prieinami vienoj vietoj.) Juose galima matyti lietuviškos muzikos, atskirų jos žanrų, kaitą bėgant metams. Prisiminti, pavyzdžiui, kaip 2007 m. muzikos būta tiek mažai, kad rinkinyje buvo apjungtos „pop/rock“ kategorijos, ir kaip net Riaubiškytė (buvo ir ji) dainavo angliškai.</p><p>Tiesa, dar patikslinsiu, kad dabar kūriniai komisijos atrenkami iš atsiųstų paraiškų, t. y. čia nebūtinai rasite kokį nors akivaizdų atlikėją, nes jis tiesiog nedalyvavo konkurse. Tačiau galit rasti kokį nors visai nežinomą, kuris nepatingėjo dalyvauti. <a href="https://emilijaviso.substack.com/p/menesio-suktinis">Čia pernai rašiau</a> apie Note Lithuania eksperimentikos rinkinį.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>(III) JAZZU „Keisti ženklai“</strong></p><iframe class="spotify-wrap album" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2734e709a992173730d57a8c82e&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Keisti Ženklai&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;Jazzu&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Album&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/1QcYd3zOjvXO3ZYGJ71Umw&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1QcYd3zOjvXO3ZYGJ71Umw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p>Labai man graži dramatiška daina „Išgėriau išrūkiau“, kur nerūpestingu tonu pasakojama apie galimai toksiškus buvusius santykius. Panašų naratyvą kitais žodžiais pasakoja ir „Vilkolakis“. Albumai gal nėra stipriausia Jazzu pusė. Ir šis nėra vientisas (nepadeda ir pridėti intro bei outro), labiau paremtas atskirais hitais (puikiu lengvabūdišku duetu su Gamka). Šiek tiek cringe’o sukėlė kūrinys „Garsiai ploju sau“, kuriame iš tiesų yra sau plojama. Vis dėlto iš Jazzu neatimsi išlavintos poptekstų rašymo rankos.</p><p>Žinau, kad daug ką atstumia Jazzu manieros, bet manau, kad labai svarbu vertinti jos talentą bei ilgametę stabilią karjerą. Nedaug teturim tokio ryškumo bei įtakingumo moterų, o tokią divą su jos pliusais ir minusais apskritai teturim vieną. Dukart teko būti Jazzu ir Somovo areniniuose koncertuose, kurie įsiminė įspūdingu Justės, kaip atlikėjos, talentu, ne tik vokaliniu, bet ir emociniu. Daug kas sako: visą širdį atiduodu, bet ten tikrai tai jautėsi.</p><div><hr></div><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78c33039-221c-440c-944e-f3e3a09eb68b_716x720.png&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5fe56d9c-143c-4f6f-bbce-cb18b39077e0_1200x1200.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/392d762c-9085-4fa4-a3fc-a3e599924192_715x721.png&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5fb35cdd-630e-4046-996a-40eba2fded0c_1456x474.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p><strong>(IV) MCLOUD „God Is Overrated“</strong></p><iframe class="spotify-wrap album" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b5f4712f4bf473fe33c23864&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;GOD IS OVERRATED&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;McLoud&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Album&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3PwjNf7UsXOKZoV3i2FaeA&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3PwjNf7UsXOKZoV3i2FaeA" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p>Jau 5tas McLoudų albumas. Kaip bėga laikas. Pavadinimas „Dievas pervertintas“ grąžina prie pirmojo - „Dievo nuleisti“. Ir pasakoja, kaip Kristus randamas kažkokiam afteryje Rusijoje. Kaip patys sakė LRT Opus, „anksčiau kastruodavom gražulius, dabar kastruojam šventuosius“. Tai tokie reikaliukai. McLoudai tęsia savo provokacijas, kurios visgi lieka pasižaidimo, pasilinksminimo lygmeny ar bent taip yra priimamos jaunos publikos. Jei būtų kiti laikai, gal visi drauge sudegintų kokio politiko mašiną. Dabar gi grupė sako: „Lietuva eina į priekį, nes mes šią vasarą gyvenam iš miesto švenčių.“ Šitas paradoksalus faktas mane ir džiugina (dėl to, kad regionai sulaukia šiek tiek daugiau šiek tiek įvairesnės muzikos nei anksčiau), ir kartu kažkaip liūdina.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>(V) NOYUS „Salva Xalva“</strong></p><div class="bandcamp-wrap album" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noyus.bandcamp.com/album/salva-xalva&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Salva Xalva, by Noyus&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;9 track album&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e2f4547-5b8e-411a-af10-451299627cf4_700x700.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Noyus&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1718871262/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=small/transparent=true/&quot;,&quot;is_album&quot;:true}" data-component-name="BandcampToDOM"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1718871262/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=small/transparent=true/" frameborder="0" gesture="media" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>Jei ieškote švelnaus skambesio, liūdno šokio, queer pop ar tiesiog įkvėpimo savarankiškai kurti, Noyus įrašė labai asmenišką, trapų albumą apie vienatvę, meilės ieškojimą ir bijojimą, geismą ir atsiribojimą.

Susiskaldžiusi į atomus, ji dažnai bando ne auginti, vertinti, provokuoti, o pateisinti savo egzistavimą, atidirbti ir įsisavinti. Todėl turime per daug kultūros leidinių, per mažai skaitytojų ir vidutinišką kokybę. Ir tuomet amžinas “Litmenis” susiima ir pasikviečia “Le Monde”, uždraudžia sau rašyti, išverčia pastarųjų metų kelis prancūzų ilgaskaičius ir šitas bendras numeris staiga užgroja. Popierius veikia, kaip internetas neveiktų: pateisina sulėtėjimą. </p><p>Horizontus plečiantys rašiniai apie viltį tragiškais laikais, dvi islamo puses, griuvėsius kaip atminį, progerija sergančią šiuolaikinę McArchitektūrą, nesugaudomą woke’izmą. Viename numeryje! <a href="https://literaturairmenas.lt/zurnalas/3797">Nusipirkite jį, gal net du</a> — “Literatūra ir menas” + “Le Monde” gali būti ir dovana.

Kitaip esi tik vartotojas, perdėm praktiškas. Tad Labatutas vos pasirodęs įsmuko į mano lentynų pilvą, o atsiverčiau tik Łukaszo Twarkowskio pakusintas. Jo ką tik pasirodęs spektaklis “Quanta”, pasirodo, turįs daug bendro su šia nefikcinės literatūros knyga. Matęs ir skaitęs galiu pasakyti: nesutinku. Iš knygos išsinešiau visai ne tas temas. Joje sutinkame mokslo haliucinacijų paraštes, kuomet suvokimas kaip viskas veikia ima sprogdinti iš vidaus, kai prieštaraujančios sąvokos sugyvena, matematika tampa poezija, fizikoje svarbsta elegantiškumas, išradimai naikina ir gelbėja žmoniją kone vienu metu, o beprotybė ir aštrus protas susikabina rankomis. BL kyšteli savo talentą išversti ir ištransliuoti nepasiekiamus mokslo laiptus į pirmiausiai, žmogiškąją dramą. Joje tiek genijams, tiek mirtingiesiems artima abejonė, konkurencija, aistra, idealizmas ir velniava. <a href="https://knygynas.biz/products/kai-liaujames-suprasti-pasauli">"Eureka!” turi.</a></p><div><hr></div><h4><em>Negrožinė knyga:</em> Vinciane Despret “Ką atsakytų gyvūnai, jei užduotume jiems teisingus klausimus?“ (Phi, 2023)</h4><p>Filosofo darbas yra nuolatos destabilizuoti: “bet juk tai tu gali matyti ir kitaip”. Despret “tai” yra gyvūnai ir ji čia apsiginklavusi ne tik skvarbiu kritiniu skalpeliu, bet ir drąsiais mokslininkais. Kartu jie vieną po kito guldo nepatogius, kreivus, retai užduodamus klausimus. Kas įdomaus eksperimentuose gyvūnams? Ar jie turi humoro jausmą?

Bet su mirusiais aktoriais reikia atsisveikinti žiūrint jų darbus. Galima apie juos pasiskaityti (AD ir ultra-dešinys buvo, ir kalėjime pasėdėjo už karo tarnybos vengimą, ir su Korsikos mafijos krikštatėviu vakarėliavo), bet žiūri filmą ir viskas aišku, ko jis buvo vertas. Pasirinkau legendinio <em>noir</em> žanro augintojo Jeano Pierre Melville lėtas, mažaemoces, tylias gaudynes “Raudonasis ratas”. Jame tūno ir nuostabi, 27 minutes trunkanti plėšimo scena be jokių žodžių, cigarete nei burna kalbantis Delono banditėlis, siurrealistiniai demonų egzorcizmai ir voriškas policijos tinklas.

We're a global community of founders and operators who've come together to support the next generation of builders. So the premise of the podcast is just that, founders interviewing other founders about the trials and tribulations of building a company. Hope you enjoy the episode.</p><p>00:00:22 Becky: Hi everyone, and welcome to the Everywhere Venture podcast. I'm Becky Yang, a venture partner at Everywhere Ventures, previously an operator in various high-growth startups and investing and consulting at the intersections of finance, tech, and climate for the last 20 years.&nbsp;</p><p>00:00:37 Becky: I'm thrilled to be here with Meredith Danberg-Ficarelli, co-founder and CEO of WATS, a waste management data company driving cost savings and waste diversion for multi-site businesses. So let's talk some trash.</p><p>00:00:50 Meredith: Happy to be here. Thanks, Becky.&nbsp;</p><p>00:00:51 Becky: So let's just dive right in. Meredith, love to hear more about your background. Walk us how you got started with WATS.</p><p>00:01:00 Meredith: Yeah, my co-founder Laura and I have been working at the intersection of commercial waste and sustainability between the two of us for more than 20 years at this point. We both found waste through composting.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:12 Meredith: For me, it was when I was in grad school in 2011, I was in the middle of a master's degree program at The New School in New York. My master's degree is in urban policy and sustainability management.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:25 Meredith: And that summer of 2011, I was lucky enough to get to travel to Beirut in Lebanon. I was placed with a nonprofit organization called Souk El Tayeb, which means the good market.</p><p>00:01:36 Meredith: They have a farmer's market and a farm to table restaurant. And my professor told me that, past spring, I know exactly where you should be stationed as a volunteer intern for the summer with this program that we were all eight students were going on this summer to Beirut.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:52 Meredith: And I trusted her and I'm really glad I did. There were two students full-time and one part-time that were with this organization. We got to eat really good food all summer.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:00 Meredith: And the first three days, they asked us, what do you want to do this summer? And I said, I didn't really know. What do you need? What do you need help with? And they said, well, we've always been curious about zero waste. How much of our waste is compostable?&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:13 Meredith: We know that a lot of it is food, potentially compostable scraps, but no one has ever been crazy enough to help us figure it out. And I was like, oh, I'll try to help. I went online, learned how to do a waste audit.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:25 Meredith: And it turns out that the executive director of the organization, Kamal Mouzawak, has a friend named Ziad Abichaker. He's an agricultural engineer and a mechanical engineer in Beirut who runs a compost company and makes materials out of plastic. He does a lot of unbelievable things there.</p><p>00:02:43 Meredith: And at the time, I just had never really seen the nutrient cycle in such magnified beauty, I guess. And I came back to New York and realized, first of all, like how can I do this here? And it really catalyzed my interest in organics recycling.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:03 Meredith: I had one more semester to go in my master's program, and I ended up moving back to Beirut. Started an organization there with my now husband, Naji, who I met at that organization. So a lot of different things happened as a result of my finding composting that summer. And that was really what led me in this direction.</p><p>00:03:22 Becky: That's amazing. What a great story. Love to hear it. Full circle.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:26 Meredith: Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:27 Becky: Completely. So, I mean, there's so many inefficiencies in this area, and it's just such a massive problem right now. Tell me more about specifically WATS, what you're working on now, and the impact you're hoping to make.</p><p>00:03:43 Meredith: I probably break this question down into a couple parts. When we launched, we were focused on data management and reporting. That was really our core competency. Because in order to drive the waste reduction outcomes that our clients were coming to us for, we needed to be able to ingest their data and be able to tell a story with that data.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:05 Meredith: And we had access to all of this data. We needed to be able to map all of their waste streams, all of their sites, all of the stakeholders across their sites. So for the first probably 18 months of WATS' existence, that was really what we were focused on. We've now transitioned to building on top of that foundation, to being able to really focus on insights.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:27 Meredith: And WATS is focused on building over the next, let's call it 12 months, is the beginning of our recommendations engine, which is really a big part of our vision. This is WATS being able to automate the steps that businesses need to take to be able to identify what they can do to reduce waste, what they can do to divert waste, and how they can save money by doing those things.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:52 Meredith: So WATS is identifying the insights that come from that data, from those operations, from their waste profiles. And then beyond that, the overall impact, if we distill those things that WATS is doing, what we're really talking about here is normalizing best practices in waste diversion for businesses.</p><p>00:05:13 Meredith: And that looks like a couple things. It's improving access to services and resources. While WATS isn't opening new waste hauling and waste processing service providers, those things are happening in the economy.</p><p>00:05:28 Meredith: Legislation and also just simply demand across different markets are leading to those things happening. But businesses don't always have access or enough information to know that those service providers exist. And WATS is helping to create those connections. And then the delivery of the insights that we're offering can drive ongoing improvements and action.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:50 Meredith: And then the last thing I would say is just that in doing the work that my co-founder Laura and I have been doing for the last decade, we recognize that a lack of time and the lack of incentives are frequently the things that cause folks not to take action on waste management.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:09 Meredith: And WATS is solving for both of those things by saving people time and by offering them, showing them the incentives to do or to take action. So maybe that's a quick recap.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:23 Becky: Yeah, no, that's perfect. Tremendous amount of work you're doing. I know when we first met actually must have been close to two years ago now. I mean, there's so much that has changed in the industry, not just in New York City, but nationally. Time incentives you mentioned, saving time for clients and customers. Can you talk a little bit about those incentives? I'd just love to hear more about that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:46 Meredith: Sure. A recent case study that we just published on our website is that, for one of our customers who is a quick serve restaurant, mostly on the West Coast, we've saved them about 70% of the time that they were spending on their waste invoice ingestion.</p><p>00:07:03 Meredith: And what they're able to focus on now as a result of those time savings is cost savings. They're able to focus on waste data invoice analysis. WATS is surfacing the opportunities that exist for them to save money.</p><p>00:07:18 Meredith: A couple other examples, I wanted to speak to one of them with one of the questions that you were going to ask later. One of the things that we're focused on with an airport that we're working with is compliance with their waste management plan. So WATS has digitized how materials are moving through their building and has organized all of the concessions that exist within their terminal.</p><p>00:07:40 Meredith: There are a lot of stakeholders that exist in an airport. There are janitorial service providers, all of these different businesses that exist and serve food to the people that are traveling through the terminal. And each of those concessions theoretically should be participating in the waste program – recycling, composting, separating their cardboard, their cooking oil, if that's one of the waste streams in their particular space.</p><p>00:08:04 Meredith: And this compliance process that we've supported putting in place helps the waste management director and his team assess the compliance of those concessions. Are they separating the recycling correctly? Is the trash can lined with the right color bag?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:24 Meredith: Trash cans should have black bags in them as opposed to clear bags because once those trash bags make their way to the loading dock, they have to be black in order to get into the right compactor.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:35 Meredith: If they're clear, they'll go into the recycling compactor instead of everything has to follow the right system so that the system doesn't break down on the many, many stages that it takes to get through such a complex space as an airport. And WATS is putting tools in place along those different stages so that the system can function at every stage.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:58 Becky: Wow. I really love that. I did a lot of travel this summer and you see these everywhere, different bins for everything. So it's such a massive problem and it's just so important that you're clarifying it for, whether it's the worker, whether it's managing it from a software perspective. Anyways, it's impressive to see how you do it.</p><p>00:09:18 Meredith: And one other thing I would add is that it gets really complicated for the individual traveler, for example, because I just explained, you know, a black bag in a trash can. And then you might want to think, oh, well, that's the norm. So okay, every trash bag should be black.</p><p>00:09:33 Meredith: That's not true. Depending on the system at a particular site, trash bags might be blue or trash bags might be clear. So you can't expect that if you go somewhere and you see something because it was one way somewhere that it's suddenly broken somewhere else.</p><p>00:09:50 Meredith: And this is one of the things that we're trying to, again, normalize with the WATS platform is that every site really does have a unique ecosystem and that those sites just need to be mapped and organized. And the folks within those sites need to be trained to be able to participate in the unique operations at their sites.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:10 Meredith: And then those sites and operations can function correctly and efficiently. And that ideally, then those materials can be separated efficiently and can make their way to their processing destinations.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:21 Becky: Yeah, I love that. The clarity is definitely key. What keeps you up at night? There's just so much to it in education. Everything is education and training. Is that one of your biggest challenges?&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:34 Meredith: What keeps me up at night? It depends on the day or the night, I should say. Right now, it's probably related to sales. If I'm in fundraising season, it's probably related to that. Running a startup is hard. I mean, that's probably the shortest way to put it.</p><p>00:10:46 Meredith: And that I'm working on methods to keep an even keel. Training is an essential piece, for sure. The way that we are baking training and education into the WATS platform, we have two categories or two tiers.</p><p>00:11:03 Meredith: One is how to use WATS. So that happens through our customer success team. And we have essentially a Wiki with videos and processes. And then the other is more of a templatized resources and methods for stakeholders to engage with their… I'm calling them ecosystems. Because every stakeholder has a different responsibility for how they engage with waste within their site.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:32 Meredith: So it really depends on who that person is and what their role is. For example, if it's a janitorial team member, what they're going to need to do and who they're going to need to talk to and how they're going to need to engage with a particular waste stream is going to be very different than if they are the director of sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:53 Meredith: And WATS has educational resources, communications templates, email templates, for example, training videos for both of those stakeholders in the platform. So if it's a janitorial team member, the training resource would probably be a video.</p><p>00:12:10 Meredith: Whereas if it's a sustainability director, it would probably be an email template that they would be copy pasting so that they could really easily email their waste hauler to request something that they need. Or to push a process or a communication forward.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:27 Becky: Got it. Love that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:28 Meredith: I actually have one other story I want to tell on the education front. Another way we can think about education tangential to the WATS platform. This is a story that I heard Ron Gonen tell about his time when he was at the New York City Department of Sanitation.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:43 Meredith: He's at Closed Loop Partners now. He was talking about the rollout of New York City's compost program in its earliest days when he was speaking with someone at a home in Staten Island. And the person he was talking to was self-proclaimed hater of sustainability. And the person said, there's no chance I'm going to use this compost bin.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:06 Meredith: And what Ron says happened is that he told the person, oh, well, this compost is actually going to a compost facility on Staten Island where it'll be composted by local people from Staten Island instead of this material ending up on a truck or a train or whatever and being shipped hundreds of miles away on a taxpayer's dime to be landfilled in someone else's backyard.</p><p>00:13:33 Meredith: And overall, it'll actually cost less to compost it than it will to landfill it. And apparently the guy said, well, why didn't you just say that in the first place? Give me the bin. I'll use it. And the moral of the story here is that you have to meet people where they are.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:49 Meredith: So whether we're talking about the resources within the WATS platform or education overall, it's really important to know who you're talking to and why they need the information that you're giving them, if you expect that information to land. And that's one of the most important lessons that I've learned over my time doing this work.&nbsp;</p><p>00:14:08 Becky: Absolutely. Definitely love that. Meeting people where they are is definitely key. Let's dive into a little bit about technology and the role technology plays in enabling zero waste operations. Talk about the technology you're using and how that's grown since we first met two years ago to now.</p><p>00:14:31 Meredith: Yeah, I admit this question is a hard one because there are so many roles that technology plays. But again, if we try to break it down into some of the core components, I mean, a super obvious one is digitization. Waste is a little bit, a little bit.</p><p>00:14:46 Meredith: Waste is very behind. If we think about where energy systems are in terms of digitization or maybe adoption of technology, waste is further behind. In commercial buildings, energy metering exists. Waste is not metered in commercial buildings in the same way.&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:05 Meredith: So when we think about digitization of waste, that is mapping the physical infrastructure. What actually are the bins that are on site? How many dumpsters are there? How big are they? How often are they collected?&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:18 Meredith: It's about education, information sharing, communications, improving operational efficiency. So the combination of those two things. I also think that it plays… There's a major role in data analysis. That's a big part of what we're doing here and delivering insights.</p><p>00:15:36 Meredith: But where I think there's a lot of technology coming into play here is on that physical infrastructure side. There's a lot of automation happening and evolving, use of artificial intelligence in the infrastructure being used in recycling facilities. Really exciting stuff.</p><p>00:15:53 Meredith: Improving both the efficiency of recycling and the safety of the workers at recycling facilities. Infrastructure changes on the equipment on trucks. It's doing the same thing in terms of efficiency and safety. And then actual machines that are changing the way that materials are being processed.&nbsp;</p><p>00:16:12 Meredith: Things that are making it easier to de-volumize and dewater organic waste so that it can be made essentially inert, dehydrating food scraps so that they're not putrescible, so that they can be transported more easily and then theoretically either composted later or amending soils closer to home, closer to where they're generated. There are tons of technologies being generated, being manufactured, not just for food waste processing, but for all kinds of materials processing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:16:42 Meredith: I could talk forever on this. I think there are also lots of other people who are probably better to answer this question about the evolution of technology in the materials space. But I would say, the last thing I would add here is just that it isn't in the same way that the circular economy is a never-ending cycle.</p><p>00:17:01 Meredith: The fact that it loops back again is what's exciting. And that's how I think about WATS, is that there isn't really an end to the value of the platform. Once an action is taken, the idea is that the user is brought right back to the start again to see what else they can do, to see what other impacts there are to make, what other optimizations can be made, and what other waste reduction opportunities or cost savings can be found from those outcomes.</p><p>00:17:28 Becky: Super interesting, Meredith. I love that full circle again. I'm on the board of the Rainforest Foundation, and carbon emissions is obviously top of mind for lots of organizations out there right now. How does WATS measure the impact of its zero waste operations on reducing carbon emissions? Maybe you want to share some stories or metrics that might highlight the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>00:17:51 Meredith: Sure, yeah. So the shortest way to put it is that WATS is using the weight of waste to calculate carbon footprint. So we're ingesting waste data through invoices and through other data sources from the entities that we're working with. So that includes the weight of waste, like trash, recycling, cardboard, but also specialty streams. I think I mentioned cooking oil earlier. You can think of mattresses or really any waste stream.&nbsp;</p><p>00:18:20 Meredith: WATS is agnostic to the waste stream and also agnostic to the data source. If no data exists or if no weight was included, WATS can support entities in gathering their own data, and WATS can estimate using extrapolations and using assumptions.</p><p>00:18:39 Meredith: And weight is super important because it allows WATS to calculate the diverted waste from each site that the business operates. So that's the amount of waste that was not sent to landfills and incinerators. And WATS automatically calculates a carbon footprint associated with that diverted waste.</p><p>00:18:57 Meredith: And it applies that footprint or essentially, it applies that footprint to the behavior of the diverted waste. So as the business increases diversion by, for example, starting a composting program, adding a new waste stream, WATS can track that increased diversion and the associated carbon footprint reduction.&nbsp;</p><p>00:19:17 Meredith: So in a recent example with one of our customers, they'd been working with WATS for about six months. Their immediate goal was to build a baseline. They have more than 100 offices across the country. And what they came to us with was, we have this diversion goal, we really want to be able to improve recycling across our entire office portfolio.</p><p>00:19:40 Meredith: And we know that we want to do better in terms of, yeah, starting to compost in a bunch of our offices, figuring out where we can add new waste streams, what else can we do? But what we know as a starting point is that we don't even have data in a lot of our buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>00:19:56 Meredith: So what they knew when they came to us was, we actually have pretty bad data. And in order to get to point B, which is improving waste diversion, we have to start at point A, which is improving data quality.</p><p>00:20:09 Meredith: And so after six months, which is right where we are today, we have this first mini case study, which is that when we started, they were at about 40% data confidence. And today we're at 72% data confidence, which is really huge. 72% is a very high data confidence number for waste data.</p><p>00:20:30 Meredith: So we're thrilled. And we were able to achieve that by identifying missing data sources and improving the availability of data where it didn't exist before.&nbsp;</p><p>00:20:40 Becky: Yeah, Meredith, that's tremendous. The data improvements and the diverted waste and how that relates to carbon emissions is just phenomenal, really. I'm a native New Yorker. New York is such a densely populated area.</p><p>00:20:55 Becky: There's just so much going on in New York all the time. People are consuming so much. Given your experience here, how does implementing zero waste initiatives in populated urban areas differ from other areas?&nbsp;</p><p>00:21:08 Meredith: New York City is really unique because it was designed without alleyways. So there's literally nowhere for trash in New York to go except in the basement or whatever storage areas of buildings, which we know there aren't any, or on the sidewalk. Yeah. Which is why we see so much trash in New York City sidewalk.&nbsp;</p><p>00:21:27 Meredith: I actually heard that the people that were originally designing New York City's grid system were distracted because they were designing the Erie Canal at the same time. I don't know if that's an urban legend. Maybe somebody, one of your listeners can call us out on that, anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>00:21:43 Becky: Amazing.</p><p>00:21:43 Meredith: Yeah. All right. So again, categories of thought here, opportunities that exist in dense urban areas. Number one, the one that I'd say I'm most excited about, Laura and I geek out about this all the time is the opportunity for decentralization, innovation and new methods for managing materials.</p><p>00:22:03 Meredith: Clare Miflin and the Center for Zero Waste Design is doing awesome work in containerizing materials. Clare Miflin has just really amazing writing and design work. She's an architect focused on how materials could be better, how space rather could be better utilized for temporarily storing waste before it needs to get collected.</p><p>00:22:29 Meredith: Because storing it on the sidewalk in pedestrian areas is not a good use of our space, but we do still have to do something with our waste in the in-between space before, between when it leaves the building, before it gets collected by a vendor.</p><p>00:22:44 Meredith: This idea of decentralization though, is for example, what we were doing at Common Ground Compost, which was the company I was running before WATS, it was running a bike-powered compost pickup service and it ran a hub and spoke model where there were electric assist cargo trikes that were picking up food scraps from commercial office buildings in New York and they would pick up small amounts from office buildings and then drop those materials at hubs in bins and loading docks basically.&nbsp;</p><p>00:23:14 Meredith: And then trucks would actually pick up from those hubs. So the bike was never hauling more than 800 or 900 pounds at a time, but we would consolidate thousands of pounds at these hubs and then trucks would come and pick up from the hubs. Those hubs could also host machines that could de-volumize materials. You could do this with any type of material. It doesn't have to be food waste.</p><p>00:23:41 Meredith: It could be shrink wrap, it could be textiles. And so the opportunity that exists to be able to centralize materials in a decentralized fashion in cities by cooperating and sharing information is massive. And then theoretically a lot of these materials have value when they're aggregated.</p><p>00:24:03 Meredith: So there builds an opportunity to be able to create true economies out of these materials. I could talk about that one for literal hours, so I'll move on. But regulatory is another opportunity, just essentially that in super dense urban areas they have to regulate how materials are managed just because they can cause problems.</p><p>00:24:27 Meredith: Politics does also play another role where, if there's a question as to whether infrastructure should be funded at all, zero waste probably isn't going to make it into the budget. And then equity is another really big one. Waste infrastructure is cited often as a contentious issue.</p><p>00:24:43 Meredith: In New York City, we've seen organizing in support of residents to support change, which is often a lot harder in rural areas. So New York City, New Jersey have really been at the forefront along with many other places of driving equity in reducing the impact of waste infrastructure on marginalized communities. So there's a couple of things.</p><p>00:25:06 Becky: Super interesting to hear that answer. Just to add to that, how do you see the field evolving over the next few years and how do you envision the future of commercial waste management and sustainability to be? And where do you see WATS playing a role in that future?&nbsp;</p><p>00:25:23 Meredith: Yeah. One of the biggest things that we're seeing businesses ask for is greater data transparency. We already talked a little bit about data quality. That's one of the areas that we're really focused on today.&nbsp;</p><p>00:25:36 Meredith: I think part of the demand for data transparency is coming from a need for reporting, improved reporting both because of corporate reporting ESG requirements, especially for businesses that have multinational footprints, especially those that have European footprints, that have to submit annual data for their European data submission requirements.</p><p>00:26:00 Meredith: What we're also seeing is a demand from consumers for greater supply chain transparency. And what that's leading to is a growth in the availability or the existence really of vendors that are offering new types of services.&nbsp;</p><p>00:26:21 Meredith: An example, just something that popped into my head is, in some cities there are now companies that are offering reusable coffee cup programs. That's a totally new thing, right? That's more of a consumer service than a business service, but it's an example and it is something that in theory would exist within the WATS platform as a service provider.</p><p>00:26:41 Meredith: And these are all little opportunities for connectivity that relate to how materials flow through systems. And this connective tissue is what WATS is digitizing. All the waste streams, all the vendors, all the stakeholders and all of the related data points are the things that the platform is mapping into a digital ecosystem.</p><p>00:27:08 Meredith: While today we are building on top of that initial digital scaffolding focused now on insights and on the recommendations over time, the platform is becoming an ecosystem that can further drive that connectivity, that can help to create the connections between the businesses and the new service providers, that can help them to take more and more steps towards further waste diversion and towards further waste reduction.&nbsp;</p><p>00:27:39 Meredith: So this idea of decentralization of relocalizing materials, maybe that does look like more localized manufacturing, growing and refueling of local economies. I'm not saying that a hundred percent of manufacturing is going to be able to be relocalized, but we know that there's demand from consumers to be able to feel like their products come from closer to where they live and being able to keep the materials supply chain closer is a part of that. And that's a piece of what WATS is working to build.&nbsp;</p><p>00:28:17 Becky: No, that's great. Super interesting future of waste and trash. Such a complicated and immense topic. So.</p><p>00:28:25 Meredith: Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:28:26 Becky: Last question before we just wrap up, how has your work in sustainability impacted your personal life? Are there practices or habits you've adopted in your own life as a result of this professional experience?&nbsp;</p><p>00:28:43 Meredith: Yeah. I mean, there are definitely too many to list. I mean, I started composting as a result of that trip to Lebanon many years ago. So I'd say it definitely led me to where I am today and it's been gradual.</p><p>00:28:58 Meredith: So if I'm giving advice to anyone, I'd say like, don't let yourself get overwhelmed. Don't try to change everything overnight. When it comes to, zero waste lifestyle, I'd say the first thing not to do is, do not follow the influencers. Don't go out and buy a bunch of stuff just to like go, zero waste.&nbsp;</p><p>00:29:18 Meredith: Start with what you already have at home. Go from there. Google things, try to figure out what to reuse, repair the things you already have, try to buy secondhand, share with your friends and neighbors. Those are the best first things to begin with. Extend the life of the things that you already have. That's the best thing you can do.&nbsp;</p><p>00:29:36 Meredith: Shop in your closet, shop in your friend's closets. I know that that sounds really boring because we want to buy things, but I've been trying to force myself to buy less and less and less every single year. And now I find it to be pretty rewarding when I do know that I need something to really, really look for the thing that I really, really want.&nbsp;</p><p>00:29:55 Meredith: And it ends up being really great. I've taught myself how to make things. There was a hurricane a couple years ago and I made some napkins out of old sheets. So these are our napkins.&nbsp;</p><p>00:30:05 Becky: Oh, I'd love you made them.&nbsp;</p><p>00:30:07 Meredith: Little things. The hurricane didn't end up being that bad, so we still had electricity, hence why I could use a sewing machine. And I started gardening. That's something that I really enjoy. So like making my own compost out of the food scraps from my mill. I have a mill that I really like.&nbsp;</p><p>00:30:22 Meredith: That's one of the home food waste dehydrator machines. It produces the first ever FDA-certified chicken feed out of food waste, which is really cool. Anyway, there's a lot of really, really awesome stuff in this space. And there's a lot of rabbit holes to dive down.</p><p>00:30:42 Becky: Super cool. Super cool. I'm getting into the gardening myself and I have my own compost and I'm someone that has composted my entire life. So, and even in New York City with the compost bins everywhere now, I didn't realize the differences in the bins and then the drop offs and all of that. And that's a whole nother topic, another time. But yeah.</p><p>00:31:05 Meredith: I won't get political.&nbsp;</p><p>00:31:06 Becky: I love less consumption. Use what you have and make sure you find joy in really finding that thing that you really like. Wrapping up quick, quick last couple of questions for the speed round, just for fun, what's a book you're reading or podcast you're enjoying right now?&nbsp;</p><p>00:31:25 Meredith: I am currently listening to two oldies, <em>Cradle to Cradle</em> and <em>Braiding&nbsp; Sweetgrass</em>. And I recommend that people pre-order a book that's about to arrive called, <em>What If We Get It Right?: Visions of Climate Futures</em> by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. She's amazing. So definitely put that one on your list. Her… the quote that I quote from her is this, “What if we get it right?” The idea of just how great could it be? So think about that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:31:57 Becky: So good, gonna get it, definitely get it. If you could live anywhere in the world for one year, where would it be, Meredith?</p><p>00:32:04 Meredith: Oh, I actually didn't think about this one before. It would probably be in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>00:32:08 Becky: Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:32:09 Meredith: They do waste really well.&nbsp;</p><p>00:32:10 Becky: Last, where can listeners find you, Meredith before I wrap up?&nbsp;</p><p>00:32:15 Meredith: You can find me on LinkedIn for sure. And then you can search for, Waste Expert on YouTube. I did a pretty fun Wired video a couple of years back.&nbsp;</p><p>00:32:23 Becky: Okay, well, thank you so much, Meredith. Love this trash talk. Trash talking with you has been fantastic. I hope you've had fun with it. Thank you so much for spending the time and I look forward to hearing all about what WATS does next.&nbsp;</p><p>00:32:39 Meredith: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

Backed by Highline Beta, Cartography Capital, and <a href="https://everywhere.vc/">Everywhere Ventures</a>, Flora is poised to disrupt traditional fertility financing by offering more affordable and accessible coverage, particularly for small businesses and self-employed individuals.

Through data-driven recommendations, Flora empowers women to enhance their fertility outcomes with non-clinical interventions like sleep, nutrition, and exercise optimization. With a focus on women aged 20 to 34, Flora is creating an ecosystem of support, combining financial coverage with community engagement to help women navigate their fertility journeys with confidence.</p><div><hr></div><p>Read more in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/10/03/flora-revolutionizing-fertility-coverage-with-individually-owned-insurance-policies/">Forbes</a>. </p></body></html>	Flora, a startup co-founded by Laura McDonald, Dr. Christy Lane, and Somil Jain, secured $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to offer the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy.	2024-10-08 17:21:57	2024-10-14 08:14:21.178	2024-10-14 09:30:45.381	{vc}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d2b6fd-5746-46af-bba4-7c2d1d98cbe2_2316x3088.jpeg	Everywhere Ventures	news-flora-raises-pre-seed-fertility-coverage-individually-owned

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared fertility a major health issue affecting one in six people, with new mechanisms of funding needed. For those who need fertility care, it can be a stressful, emotional, and expensive journey. Most health insurance plans do not fully cover fertility treatments (if at all) and many people&nbsp; are forced to pay out-of-pocket. Flora is addressing that gap.&nbsp; <br><br><a href="https://www.heyflora.co/">Flora</a> will be the first individually-owned fertility insurance product, giving people control over their reproductive health and offering coverage beyond most traditional group plans. It will be available through trusted channel partners, such as health apps and affinity groups in a B2B2C model. The product also fits with employer voluntary and flex benefits, ensuring personalized health coverage and plan portability. In doing so, Flora is empowering the next generation of parents by giving individuals autonomy and security around their future ability to build a family.</p><p>Co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurajaynemcdonald/">Laura McDonald</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christyclane/">Dr.Christy Lane</a> are both seasoned entrepreneurs residing in Canada and launching the product across North America. Laura brings extensive experience from the finance and insurance sectors. She also founded and exited a digital media company focused on women and wealth, which became the largest in Canada in that space. Christy is a global leader at the intersection of digital health, AI, and insurtech, with decades of experience in analytics and women’s health. She is the founder of the Stanford Wearable Health Lab, and was the founder and CEO of Vivametrica, an insurtech she saw through a successful exit. Their co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/somiljainconsulting/">Somil Jain</a> (based in the U.S.) joined later, contributing his expertise as a chief actuary for major digital insurance companies. Flora is a team that’s passionate about insurance and helping the next generation have security around their future fertility. They recently announced their <a href="https://ideas.everywhere.vc/p/news-flora-raises-pre-seed-fertility-coverage-individually-owned-insurance">$1.5 million pre-seed round</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>What’s Flora’s mission?</strong></h4><p>Our mission is to create community and capital to fund the underserved market of fertility and women's reproductive health. We believe funding for fertility treatment shouldn’t be determined solely by your employer or your state. By establishing an individually-owned fertility insurance product, we aim to empower people with the resources they need for reproductive autonomy.</p><h4><strong>What inspired you to create Flora?</strong></h4><p><strong>Laura</strong>: My background is in finance and insurance, where I’ve spent many years bringing new products to market. I previously founded a digital media company focused on women and wealth, which became the largest in Canada in that space. While I was fortunate to have four children without fertility problems, witnessing a close family member struggle with treatments opened my eyes to the significant challenges and affordability issues people face. Given my background, I began thinking about how insurance, which is essentially a community of people funding one another's risk, could address this issue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Christy</strong>: Two of my three babies were born through fertility treatment. This deep understanding of the problem we are solving from both the emotional and financial sides, is what led me to co-found Flora. I bring expertise in both healthcare and insurance, with decades of studying women’s health and risk assessment. Through my experience building the Stanford Wearable Health Lab and my previous company Vivametrica, I’ve learned how to launch innovative risk models and impactful products. I am fiercely passionate about women’s health and supporting women and girls in STEM, and strive to build products that will make life better for my two daughters and my son.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How does Flora inspire “customer love”?</strong></h4><p>Our initial target customers are women aged 20 to 34 who want security about their future ability to build a family. We’ve done research with one of the largest menstrual tracking apps, and we found that 50% of their North American users are concerned about their future fertility, even if they don't have children yet. Many are willing to pay out of pocket for this kind of coverage, which shows how important this is to them. We have a waitlist for <a href="https://www.heyflora.co/">Flora</a> prior to our upcoming launch and have been blown away by the engagement from our future policyholders.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What’s on the horizon for Flora?</strong></h4><p>We plan to launch our first product in the U.S. by early 2025, with Canada following afterward. In terms of coverage, we're looking at offering up to $50,000 of lifetime coverage for fertility treatment, which far exceeds most group-based products on the market today. We want our premiums to be affordable, as low at $15 per month, up to about $70. We are passionate about Flora's potential to not only be a good business model, but also have a significant social impact. We want to use our capital to make monumental shifts in the way we look at reproductive health as a whole and to ensure underserved markets and issues get funded.</p><p><strong>Fun facts:<br>Laura</strong>: I used to dabble in acting in my 20s and even had a film go to the Sundance Film Festival. Learning pages of scripts in hours and going into stressful auditions requires more skill and grit than you can imagine. It prepared me for being a founder, as I learned to communicate more effectively and deal with high stress situations. I think every founder would benefit from taking an acting class, because it will help them pitch and refine their story, and put themselves out there.</p><p><strong>Christy</strong>: My very first research study was the first study ever to use wearable devices to understand health risks for women who were on bed rest in hospitals with high risk pregnancies. I developed my grit as an entrepreneur early, planting over 1 million trees in northern Canada - if you can be a tree planter you can do any job! Playing and coaching rugby for 25 years has also provided me with a lot of insight into teamwork and creating community.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>Listen to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredithdf/">Meredith Danberg-Ficarelli</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/beckyyangprofile/">Becky Yang</a> on the Venture Everywhere podcast: <a href="https://ideas.everywhere.vc/p/podcast-trash-talk-meredith-danberg-ficarelli-becky-yang-episode48">Trash Talk</a>.

This idea sounds like clickbait Alex Hormozi garbage to the masses.</p><p>It feels like it’s time to roll out the cliche “Do what you love little Timmy Tucker.” Over the last few years I’ve turned my life into a video game. The only objective of this game is I want to keep playing it forever.</p><p>That means I need to continue to get paid to play this game. The difference here is I’m not doing the work I do to earn money or get rich. I just want to keep doing this type of work that feels like play to me.</p><p>It’s a radical mindset that blows up most people’s brains.</p><p>I didn’t invent this way of life, and I stumbled across it by pure accident. Here’s how you, too, can get paid to play and experience what is the best feeling in the world.</p><h1>Don’t play stupid games with stupid people</h1><p>The most important goals always start with figuring out what you don’t want (also known as anti-goals).</p><p>I used to spend my days in meeting rooms playing stupid games with stupid people. I never got anything done. Even changing a logo on a sales page required a committee of pinheads to agree.</p><p>I’d wake up and answer stupid work emails that a chatbot could easily answer. I’d sell stupid bank products that I didn’t agree with to stupid people who thought these products would make them rich (banking products make the bank rich, not you).</p><p>I disliked most people I met in business. They were so mediocre.</p><p>They’d have Friday drinks, get drunk, watch the football, and talk about some meaningless Netflix show. It all felt so … boring. I accepted this boredom as my reality. I’d never known any other way to live.</p><p>My life felt stupid.</p><p>I eventually got off this hamster wheel. I discovered that people were building new careers for themselves on the internet with no boss and no employer. It seemed like clickbait at the start until I was surrounded by an army of people living this way.</p><p>They chose a topic, made it their obsession, then centered their whole life around it. I discovered they turned their life into a video game.</p><h1>Get paid to keep playing the video game you obsess over</h1><p>Once I succeeded at online writing it was all I wanted to do.</p><p>When I quit my 9-5 job the stakes became higher. My mantra became, “How do I keep getting paid to play this amazing video game?” It wasn’t a game of survival or trying to become a rich b*tch so I could buy a Lambo and take selfies in Santa Monica.</p><p>I just wanted to keep living the video game…</p><ul><li><p>Wake up whenever</p></li><li><p>See my daughter whenever</p></li><li><p>Goof off a day a week</p></li><li><p>Walk in the sunshine</p></li><li><p>Hit the gym 4 times a week (whenever)</p></li><li><p>Work from home or an Airbnb anywhere in the world</p></li><li><p>Never get told what to do by a micro-managing boss ever again</p></li><li><p>Write every day without filtering who I am or worrying about opinions</p></li></ul><p>So I set up my online business to do that.</p><p>This meant I had to…</p><ol><li><p>Find predictable income streams</p></li><li><p>Make money from my strengths</p></li><li><p>Find ways to make recurring revenue</p></li><li><p>Learn how to craft high-ticket offers ($10,000+)</p></li><li><p>Build affiliate partnerships</p></li><li><p>Grow my email list</p></li><li><p>Figure out how to get predictable traffic to my email list</p></li></ol><p>These seven steps allowed me to set up a foundation to keep getting paid for the rest of my life. It’s the kind of feeling I can’t describe. I’m 100% self-sufficient and will never ask an employer for a salary again. It’s what I call the permissionless life.</p><p>Here are the steps if you want to do the same.</p><h1>1. Turn an “interest” into an obsession</h1><p>There’s a threshold of participation most people never reach.</p><p>It’s easy to get h0rny when you’re in the virgin territory of a new interest. Those first few weeks of a new interest are orgasmic. But after the endorphins wear off the average person can’t keep the habit of an interest long enough to get results.</p><p>They need dopamine. They need the ear candy of compliments and strangers kissing their smelly feet to keep going.</p><p>The only way to overcome this “interest” problem is to dial up the intensity. </p><p>I call it “going all in.” You must fully commit. </p><ul><li><p>For some people that means quitting their job. </p></li><li><p>For others it means giving up all their other hobbies. </p></li><li><p>In my case it meant dumping my ex-girlfriend so I could get rid of all BS distractions and focus on online writing.</p></li></ul><p>It also means putting ya money where ya big mouth is.</p><p><em>Interest</em> is hard to maintain. When you invest money in an interest you start to expect an ROI. That gives you leverage on your lazy self (a side we all have) to wake up early and actually put in the work.</p><p>No money, no commitment.</p><p>Interests need to peculate for long enough too. The 10,000-hour rule is a good rule of thumb. But doing the same thing over and over and expecting results is the definition of insanity. The 10,000-hour rule also needs 10,000 iterations.</p><p>To dial up the intensity to the max you also need to be around other people on their way to obsession who care about similar things. Obsession is an identity. It’s not for everyone, but without it you stay a no one.</p><p>Go all in or don’t get paid to play. Ever.</p><blockquote><p><em>Obsession turns average people into outliers – Zach Pogrob</em></p></blockquote><h1>2. Value growth more than you value safety</h1><p>I spoke to a guy today.</p><p>His email started with “I’m obsessed.” He then went on to tell me he’s only willing to explore his obsession if it’s free. He won’t invest in anything from anyone. I suggested a $100 option he could try from a creator I admire. He still wouldn’t do it.</p><pre><code>If you won’t invest $100 in your obsession, you’re not obsessed.</code></pre><p>You’re lying to yourself. Where we invest money helps us to understand what we care about. Mastery in any field isn’t free.</p><p>(For some reason people will pay $100K for a mostly useless college degree though.) What stops us investing in our obsession is we’re taught to value safety more than we are to take risks.</p><pre><code>An investment always carries some risk but so, too, does playing it safe.</code></pre><p>People spend so much time trying to protect the little they already got, that they miss out on the enormous upside they could have by investing in their obsession.</p><p><strong>Most people’s security blankets aren’t worth protecting.</strong> $20,000 in savings feels like a lot, but you can never really live an extraordinary life with it.</p><p>You’ll always be one step away from broke. One curveball. One medical disaster. One parking fine. Bam. It’s all gone. Mayday, mayday. That’s no way to live.</p><p>Protecting the little you have is a sign of a scarcity mindset. Obsession is fuelled by a growth mindset grounded in optimism.</p><p>You must believe life can be better than it is to truly get paid to play for the rest of your life.</p><h1>3. Get so good people pay you</h1><p>Work that feels like play doesn’t turn into money until you get good.</p><p>In my case, there are a lot of writers online. Anyone can write. But most never get paid to do it every day because they don’t master the video game. Like anything, there are a stack of micro skills needed to go beyond the average results most will achieve.</p><p>On the surface it looks like all you need to do is write. Once you get far enough into the game you realize there’s 100x more to it.</p><p>At this point you can either get overwhelmed and frustrated by it, or you can play the game and push yourself to mastery. Either way, people won’t pay until you get good.</p><p>So you either good, or keep falling short and wondering why you never can get paid to do work that feels like play while others do it and make it look easy.</p><p>I don’t make the rules. Use obsession to get good or give up.</p><p>There are millions of office cubicle jobs on LinkedIn right now that’d be glad to have you, so you can play boring office games until 65, then die. Choose wisely.</p><h1>4. “Work turns into play when improvement turns into <s>passion</s> obsession”</h1><p>(Dan Koe)</p><p>There’s a meme on Twitter/X that goes “XYZ thing is self-improvement in disguise.</p><ul><li><p>Business is self-improvement in disguise.</p></li><li><p>Gym is self-improvement in disguise.</p></li><li><p>Leadership is self-improvement in disguise.</p></li><li><p>Losing weight is self-improvement in disguise.</p></li><li><p>Writing is self-improvement in disguise.</p></li></ul><p>All of these and more are true. What makes a goal a video game that’s fun to play is when improvement is built in.</p><p>As Dan Koe says, work turns into play when you force yourself to improve. This improvement mechanism is how you progress from an interest to an obsession. That’s what happened with me and writing.</p><p>I kept wanting to improve. I kept challenging myself to write better essays, do more research, and attract more email subscribers. The improvement aspect is now automated. It’s a flywheel that keeps on spinning and won’t die out until I die.</p><p>Not improving is where people go wrong.</p><p>We’ve all seen it. You know, the friend who sells their arts and crafts at the Sunday market each week and is still doing the same number of sales that they did a year ago. Or worse, their sales keep plummeting.</p><p>They never move out of hobby mode because they haven’t set up systems to force improvement. And they refuse to pay for help or consider the real fact their business is sh*t and will never make money.</p><p>1%-better-each-day is cheesy as hell because it works.</p><h1>Closing Thought</h1><p>The best goal you can ever have is to turn a passion into an obsession, then get paid to play this infinite video game for the rest of your life.</p><p>Somehow I figured out this glitch in the matrix. I’m not the only one. Every day more people are building small online empires around their obsession. If you’re bored in life, it’s time to migrate to a new way of living.</p><p>Tell me which of these ideas above you find useful and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

Today we report the first topline results of a project we are collaborating on focused on better understanding the views of ordinary Americans on energy and climate. We present the eye-opening highlights of a new detailed YouGov survey of Americans on climate and energy — a survey that we designed and conducted a few weeks ago. —RP</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>The future of the clean energy transition is cloudy. It’s well-known that there are disagreements—wide disagreements—between Republicans and Democrats about our energy future. But less well-known is the bedrock of public opinion on America’s energy supply, the importance of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, and the general salience of the climate change issue.</p><p>Findings from a new YouGov survey indicate that most voters’ views differ quite a bit from those of rapid energy transition advocates. These views constitute an ineluctable reality that any transition, on any timetable, will have to deal with. At the same time there is political opportunity here to better align policy priorities with voter preferences.</p><p>This survey is part of a broader study conducted by Roger Pielke, Jr. and Ruy Teixeira of the American Enterprise Institute that seeks to compare scientific understandings of energy and climate with dominant public narratives on these issues and how both compare to the views of actual voters.</p><p>The full study and polling data will be released after the election but here we present ten of the most interesting findings from our new survey that shed light on the current debate around climate and energy issues.</p><p>1. <em><strong>An "all of the above" approach to energy policy has by far the most voter support and shows remarkable stability and common support across voter groups</strong>.</em></p><p>When presented with a choice among three options—a rapid green energy transition, an “all of the above” energy policy, and emphasizing fossil fuels—American voters across demographics and partisanship strongly prefer an “all of the above” approach to energy policy including oil, gas, renewables, and nuclear. Less than a quarter support a rapid transition to renewables, which drops to under a fifth for working-class (noncollege) voters. Even among Democrats, support for a rapid transition is only a little over a third.</p><p>2. <em><strong>On extreme weather events, most voters have not accepted the apocalyptic reporting found in the media and pushed by climate activists</strong>.</em></p><p>Most people hold views of trends in extreme weather events that are consistent with the most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They do <em>not</em> say they have personally observed an increase in hurricanes, floods, drought, or tornadoes which is consistent with the current state of scientific understandings. The exception is heat waves where, consistent with the IPCC, a majority report that they have observed an increase in such events.</p><p>3. <em><strong>American voters are reluctant to pay even a small amount to support climate action and this willingness drops quickly as the proposed small costs increase</strong></em>.</p><p>When asked if they would support just a $1 monthly fee on their electricity bill to fight climate change, only 47 percent say they would while almost as many (43 percent) are opposed. Even at this level, opposition is greater than support among working-class voters. When the proposed fee is increased to $20, overall voter support plummets to 26 percent with 60 percent opposed. At $40, it is 19 percent support to 69 percent opposition; at $75 it is 15 percent vs. 72 percent; and at $100 it is 7:1 against (77 percent to 11 percent) paying such a fee to combat climate change.</p><p>4. <em><strong>Voters expect an energy transition away from fossil fuels to lead to unexpected problems</strong>.</em></p><p>About two-thirds think problems are likely. A follow-up question indicates that voters are most worried about the impact on the prices of energy and everyday goods and about the impact on the reliability of the electrical grid. Voters are most positive about the impact of an energy transition on job opportunities in the energy sector and on air and water quality.</p><p>5. <em><strong>Overall, the public is much more favorable on both solar and natural gas than on wind, suggesting that the concept of "renewables" masks some important differences</strong>.</em></p><p>Solar energy tests the best among five energy sources that voters were asked to rank. Thirty-eight percent of voters ranked solar first. Natural gas did the second best, picked first by 26 percent of voters. Nuclear energy came third (15 percent ranked it first) followed by wind (10 percent) and coal (6 percent). Coal is clearly the least preferred energy source with 38 percent ranking it dead last among options. Wind and nuclear also have strong opposition with, respectively, 19 percent and 29 percent ranking the technology their least favorite option.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NDM0MTg3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDk5ODA5MDcsImlhdCI6MTcyODU2NTU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzMxMTU3NTQ1LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjM5MDU4Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.0EkXBMnesXBGELGduAQzpEuYTW4rH7FPqE7uTIB4Gns&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NDM0MTg3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDk5ODA5MDcsImlhdCI6MTcyODU2NTU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzMxMTU3NTQ1LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjM5MDU4Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.0EkXBMnesXBGELGduAQzpEuYTW4rH7FPqE7uTIB4Gns"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>6. <em><strong>In terms of the energy they consume, cost and reliability are way, way more important to voters than possible effects on the climate</strong>.</em></p><p>Given four choices, 37 percent of voters said the cost of the energy they use was most important to them and 36 percent said the availability of power when they need it was most important. Just 19 percent thought the effect on climate of their energy consumption was most important and 6 percent selected the effect on U.S. energy security.</p><p>7. <em><strong>In terms of proposals to mitigate the effects of climate change, getting to “net zero” as quickly as possible is relatively unimportant to voters</strong>.</em></p><p>Asked to consider proposals to reduce the effects of global climate change, voters were least likely to say “getting the U.S. to net zero carbon emissions as quickly as possible” was very important to them personally (29 percent), fewer than said “limiting the burden of regulations on business” was very important (32 percent). Voters were most likely by far to say keeping consumer costs low (66 percent) and increasing jobs and economic growth (60 percent) were very important aspects of climate mitigation proposals. The split was wider among working-class voters: 71 percent thought keeping consumer costs low was very important, compared to 26 percent who thought rapidly getting to net zero was very important.</p><p>8. <em><strong>Climate change as an issue has very low salience to voters</strong>.</em></p><p>Voters were asked to evaluate a list of 18 issue areas and rate their priority for the president and Congress to address in the coming year. As a “top priority,” dealing with global climate change ranked 15<sup>th</sup> out of these 18 areas, well behind strengthening the national economy, fighting inflation, defending the country from terrorist attacks, and keeping Social Security financially sound—and also behind reducing health care costs, dealing with immigration, improving the educational system, keeping energy costs low, reducing the budget deficit, reducing crime, improving how the political system works, improving the job situation, strengthening the military, and dealing with the problems of poor people. The climate issue only ranked above global trade, drug addiction, and issues around race.</p><p>9. <em><strong>Voters support increased domestic production of fossil fuels, but they are unaware fossil fuel production has actually increased in the last several years</strong>.</em></p><p>By 22 points (56-34), voters favor more domestic production of fossil fuels—oil and gas. Working-class voters felt even more strongly, endorsing the idea by 30 points. But only 17 percent of voters are aware that the Biden administration has increased oil production on federal lands. However, when informed that the U.S. has, in fact, increased domestic production of oil and gas in the last several years, they are delighted. Almost seven in ten (69 percent) said “this is a positive development, which brings good jobs for U.S. workers, ensures our energy supply and helps the U.S. support our allies who need similar resources” compared to 31 percent who thought “this is a negative development, which brings more pollution, climate change, and continued reliance on fossil fuels.”</p><p>10. <em><strong>Voter interest in electric heat pumps, hot water heaters and stoves, as well as electric vehicles, is weak</strong>.</em></p><p>Asked whether they had given serious thought to making certain “green” changes in their home within the past 12 months, 75 percent of voters said they either had not given serious thought to installing an electric heat pump or that that device was not relevant to them; 67 percent said the same thing about an electric water heater as did 61 percent about an electric stove or induction system.</p><p>Voters by 17 points (52-35) say they are opposed to phasing out new gasoline cars and trucks by 2035 and many more voters are upset (48 percent) than excited (21 percent) by the idea of phasing out production of gas-powered cars and trucks. By 18 points (59-41), voters say they are not likely to even consider purchasing an electric vehicle as their next car. Just 10 percent say they now own an electric vehicle and two-thirds of those are hybrid rather than fully electric. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>Thanks for reading and commenting!

Sterilising is great to get numbers down and we can adopt out a small handful of dogs and fix health issues on the street. The truth is that is just isn’t enough. </p><p>Those tools alone will not fix this problem. It is now becoming abundantly clear to me that we need to roll out the following…</p><ul><li><p><strong>Educational programmes</strong>. We need to get locals on board with what we are going. That has already started with Thai staff and working in the communities. We are struggling for manpower and resources to roll our a full educational programme right now in 2024 but we need to do something. If we don’t it’s just a constant uphill battle</p></li><li><p><strong>Governmental initiatives</strong>. I need to find ways to work with the authorities. That can be logistical help, enforcing existing laws or full on partnerships.</p></li></ul><p>We are sterilising 6000 dogs a month, have adopted 36 dogs out this year, we have Happy Doggo land and we feed 1000 dogs a day. Keeping all that going isn’t easy but without education and government support we won’t fix this. We’ll find a way to get it done. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:754593,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252974b3-797d-4720-b861-5efb33151e09_2048x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>The Mental Toll</h3><p>Although the days are long, I don’t find the physical effort super hard.

No in between. That view of the world is a little harsh for my liking. As always the truth lies in the nuance.</p><p>I never used to see myself as a high performer. My younger years were full of failures. My childhood was too. We lost our family home not once but twice. Kids used to make fun of me.</p><p>In 2013 my entire world changed forever.</p><p>I went to a Tony Robbins seminar that rewired my brain. I started to think differently. That made me weird which made me feel good. For the last 11 years, I’ve been on the path of high performance and in the top 1% of my field.</p><p>High performers aren’t what they seem. You’ve been lied to.</p><h1>Lie #1 – There’s a lot of competition</h1><p>No there isn’t.</p><p>What I do is lonely because there isn’t any real competition. And when there is a competitor, they last about 6 months and then give up or go out of business.</p><p>When there’s no competition it feels lonely. You have no one to aspire to be like. It’s hard to find idols. What you do can even feel boring.</p><p>So the problem to solve isn’t that you’ll have so many competitors no one will pay attention to what you do. No. The problem is that you’ll discover there is no competition and feel lonely.</p><p>Learning to deal with the loneliness is not always easy, but it’s an attribute of obsessed people who chase their mission to its illogical conclusion.</p><h1>Lie #2 – You’re missing some key bits of information</h1><p>I’ve helped 6000+ people start writing online.</p><p>At the start I thought they were all missing some key strategy or insight that I could provide them. I’ve since learned people are drowning information.</p><p>Low performers keep acquiring more information and never implementing it because they fear failure. I came across an example yesterday.</p><p>Guy tells me he wants to build an online empire. He mentions he’s about to start his third degree (Master's) at age 40. He says the latest degree has drained his bank account and his family is struggling financially.</p><p>I politely told him if he wanted to join my inner circle he might not fit in because most of my community don’t believe in college degrees anymore. In his case he’s onto his third degree and still getting zero results while dealing with the pain of poverty.</p><p>He blew up at me when I told him this.</p><blockquote><p>“Never meet your heroes. You piece of sh*t, Denning.”</p></blockquote><p>An even bigger sign of a low performer is when they’re easily offended at a harmless remark like “you may not like our community.”</p><p>This example illustrates perfectly why more information isn’t the answer. Credentialism has led to people overloading their brains with more information, so they turn into adult babies who lack emotional intelligence and the ability to deal with failure or rejection.</p><pre><code>Obsession driven by daily habits backed by systems will get you 10x further than more information from a professor.</code></pre><p>It’s lonely being a high performer because most of the world thinks they lack information. Asking for permission and following the proven path is the default, which only leads to us becoming overwhelmed and drowning in busyness.</p><p>If you can stop being an information wh0re and digitally hoarding mountains of information, you will change the world.</p><h1>Lie #3 – People are fearless</h1><p>When you compare yourself to people on social media, it’s easy to think everyone’s winning and you’re not. This is untrue.</p><p>People aren’t fearless.</p><p>In the surveys I’ve run for the last 5 years around writing and online business the pattern has always been the same.</p><p>We’re afraid of:</p><ul><li><p>Failing</p></li><li><p>Imposter syndrome</p></li><li><p>Not feeling like an expert</p></li><li><p>Not being experienced enough</p></li><li><p>Being trolled or getting hateful comments</p></li></ul><p>The average person never gets over these fears. They prevent them from ever taking action and they never learn that it’s their fear holding them back. When you have the privilege of interacting with people from all walks of life you learn the truth.</p><pre><code>Most people are destroyed by their fears.</code></pre><p>There are very few fearless people in the world. I consider myself fearless. It makes me lonely at times. I can only name 2-3 other people who I consider to be fearless.</p><p>It makes me feel like an outlier.</p><p>As a result, I can’t comprehend how people can possibly stay in dead-end jobs when each day they’re slowly dying and their bodies are breaking down with age.</p><p>So I have to have fewer friends.</p><div><hr></div><p>Last weekend I went to a lunch with my wife’s friends. </p><p>I sat in the corner playing with my 1 year old because I couldn’t relate to the other people. They sat there and complained about their careers.</p><p>One of them even shared how his employer missed paying his salary the week prior. The whole company didn’t get paid. Their employer is struggling to pay their bills. Salaries finally got paid 4 days later because the company won a trademark infringement court case.</p><p><em>All I could hear were alarm bells.</em></p><p>The guy heard nothing. He went back to work. “She’ll be right.” I give his employer 4 weeks before they go into liquidation. He doesn’t want to change because he’s comfortable, so he just bullsh*ts himself to keep going to the office.</p><p>If you can learn to overcome fear you can easily join the top 1%.</p><h1>Lie #4 – The market is saturated</h1><p>I lied. This one is true.</p><p>But the market is saturated with low quality, piss poor crap. Excellence used to be the way. Humans used to make beautiful stuff. Now we churn out billions of widgets that all look the same and can serve a function, sure, but inspire no one.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg" width="1456" height="1905" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1905,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:627892,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Image Credit-Culture Critic via X</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s most obvious with architecture. Buildings used to be beautiful. Now they’re depressing brutalist concrete blocks that are soulless and make humans feel like machines. So the market is saturated but with depressing offerings.</p><p>I operate in the online business and writing niches. What scares me isn’t the market, it’s how bad most products and services are.</p><p>There’s little to no effort. They’re slapped together in a few hours, then wrapped in sensationalist irresistible marketing that’s nothing more than broken promises.

They’re going to get started. Just not right now. They’re busy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing isn’t right. They’re getting their ducks in a row (they probably should shoot those ducks in the head).</p><p>If not now, then f*cking when?</p><p>What’s so special about 2025 compared to 2024? It’s lonely in high performer land because we don’t delay goals. If it’s a goal it’s a priority for today. If it’s not a goal then we stop thinking about it and ma$turbating over it. There’s no in between.</p><blockquote><p>Most people have too many goals. Too many bright ideas.</p></blockquote><p>It’s better to have one goal and forget all the other shiny objects. But this way of thinking is uncommon. When I tell people I’m 10 years into my writing goal and have 30+ years to go, they think I’m crazy. The mission is overly simplistic. There’s no chopping and changing. It’s driven by pure obsession.</p><p>A reader emailed me yesterday. “Tim, I think you’ve lost touch with what people are going through. You’ve made too many millions of dollars.”</p><p>Maybe they’re right. That thought makes me even lonelier. I don’t understand distractions and shallow work done in a noisy office where you can’t think.</p><p>What the reader said next made more sense. They said they didn’t know how I could write online and lose all of my privacy. They didn’t get how I could play what they call the “social media game.”</p><p>But I have plenty of privacy. Most people who do what I do use a nickname. My friend Dan Koe is a great example. You didn’t think his real name was Dan Koe, did you? Lol. It’s a made up name.</p><p>Social media isn’t some Squid Game to me either. I’m online building an empire around my obsession which feels effortless. So it’s not some useless game I play to make money. Money never was the goal.</p><p>When you have clarity on what you love doing, the desire to delay it until next year or some future point when you’re dead becomes a crazy idea.</p><p>You either start the goal today or never. If you choose today it’s the most lonely path.</p><h1>Closing Thought</h1><p>I don’t mind being lonely.</p><p>To me, there’s nothing worse than being stuck in a crowd of people who want to fit in while simultaneously wasting their lives away achieving nothing.</p><p>Then following the crowd to a sports game to get drunk and try to forget about their lack of progress, only to wake up with a hangover on Monday morning to relive Groundhog day once more on repeat until retirement followed by death ~10 years later.</p><p>Choose the lonely path. Dare to implement high-performance habits that’ll make you weird.</p><p>Tell me which of the lies above resonated the most and why in the comments.</p><p>P.S. Want to get more followers on Substack?

The market is saturated with low-quality offerings, creating an opportunity for inspiring work. Delaying goals until the future is a common mistake. Choosing the lonely path of high performance can lead to a new renaissance.	2024-10-10 19:18:46	2024-10-11 14:01:41.689	2024-10-11 14:01:43.033	{english}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb03c8cad-ea12-4bd1-bf08-08dad0ebb560_1042x667.jpeg	Tim Denning	being-a-high-performer-is-lonely-as-hell

<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-denk/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Tyler</a></strong>, CEO and co-founder of <strong><a href="https://beehiiv.com/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">beehiiv</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>I was the second employee at <strong><a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Morning Brew</a></strong> and built a lot of the product and the growth tools that led to the success of Morning Brew.</p><p>beehiiv is an all-in-one platform for newsletters. It’s a creator-friendly newsletter platform that makes it easy to design, write, send, promote, monetize, and track the ROI of your newsletter.</p><h3><strong>Please share what you can about the fundraising journey for the company so far.</strong></h3><p>When I was 27 and my co-founders were 24, we didn’t have much capital to fund the business ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>We raised a seed round of $2.6M. About 8 months later we achieved what I considered product-market fit and were around $15-20k in monthly revenue.</p><p>We raised a $1.6M seed extension to cover expenses, but eventually needed more.</p><p>By mid-2020, we raised a Series A of $12.5M from <strong><a href="https://lsvp.com/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Lightspeed</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>At that point, our team was burnt out, and I was handling support tickets at midnight.&nbsp;</p><p>We had strong growth but I realized it wasn’t sustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>I drafted a plan envisioning what we’d do with $10M, and it became clear that raising more capital was necessary to ensure stability and mitigate risks, such as maintaining consistent growth and avoiding potential outages.</p><p>We eventually raised a $33M Series B from <strong><a href="https://www.nea.com/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">NEA</a></strong> and other investors to continue scaling.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the competitive market, the choice was between staying lean or going all-in to capture more market share.&nbsp;</p><p>I opted for the latter, understanding the risks, but also the potential for significant growth.</p><h2><strong>Fundraising Strategy</strong></h2><h3><strong>What did you plan ahead of time to use the money for?</strong></h3><p>We needed upfront contracts for services like Heroku and AWS, but we weren’t in a financial position to cover those costs. That’s actually a big part of why we did the seed round.</p><p>I made a classic founder mistake of thinking that a seed round of $2.6M was a large amount, especially with only 2 co-founders and minimal expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>But to be competitive, we had to offer benefits like 401(k)s and health insurance.&nbsp;</p><p>Top engineers cost over $200k and our runway quickly shortened. That’s when we raised our seed extension.</p><h2><strong>Investor Strategy</strong></h2><h3><strong>How did you decide which investors would be a good fit?</strong></h3><p>We looked for angel investors who could also be early adopters. For example, Houck invested.</p><p>When entering a very competitive market, I was fully aware that we had the least polished product on the market by nature, being a few weeks old.</p><p>But when we raised our seed round we actually raised from different strategic angels who had a newsletter on a competing platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A very simple ask in the early days to build momentum was to have those angel investors move their newsletter over to beehiiv.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those angels was using another competitor and had 100k subscribers at the time.</p><p>I didn't even know that we could handle 100k emails being sent at once, but they moved over without hesitation and gave us a ton of credibility.</p><h2><strong>Fundraising Process</strong></h2><h3><strong>What did you emphasize in your pitch?</strong></h3><p>My 2 co-founders and I were also software engineers at Morning Brew.&nbsp;</p><p>In the early days, when the product wasn't up to snuff with the competition, we were selling a vision that we already did this, and that we’d built this at Morning Brew.</p><p>We said we're building the same tools but better. And maybe it wasn’t all built out at the time,&nbsp;but if you follow the success of Morning Brew, you're selling a narrative and the vision of what's to come.</p><p>I’d also pitched the ad network knowing that we were never going to write a single line of code for the ad network for probably a year and a half to two years.</p><p>We were building different dashboards and queries and structured our database around data that would eventually be used for optimizing ads at some point in the future. We showed we had a long-term plan.</p><p>The legacy platforms that have been around for 10 or 15 years would have to work through so much tech debt to retrofit their platform to be hyper optimized for ads.</p><p>It’s a massive bet. There aren’t that many super large ad networks and it hasn’t been done well in email anywhere.</p><h3><strong>What did you do to drive urgency among investors and close the round?</strong></h3><p>By building in public and openly sharing our growth metrics we create a narrative that everyone is moving to beehiiv, which reassures potential customers and builds credibility.</p><p>It also attracts investor interest. Whenever we hit milestones like $100k or $500k MRR, I receive numerous inquiries from investors wanting to lead future rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t waste time nurturing every potential investor relationship. Instead I focus on building the product. If our growth metrics are strong, investors will find us.</p><p>We raised our Series A in 7 days and Series B in 10, thanks to this approach.&nbsp;</p><p>I include potential investors in our monthly updates, which detail everything from what went well to our strategies and upcoming launches.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time we’re ready to raise funds, these investors are already well-informed and ready to engage, making the fundraising process much more effective and efficient.</p><h3><strong>What was the biggest challenge that came up during fundraising?</strong></h3><p>For the seed round it was tough.&nbsp;</p><p>Substack was venture-backed. They started 3 years before us. Their Series B had a $650M valuation.</p><p>Substack already had a multi year lead with probably at that point $80-90M of funding already secured.</p><p>Mailchimp's massive, they've exited and have multi billion dollars in revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>You could list two dozen other email providers and then at the exact time that we went out in the market, Twitter had just acquired Revue and Facebook just launched Bulletin.</p><p>It was established legacy players along with a new wave of VC-backed players that already had head starts on us.</p><h3><strong>Any unique or interesting fundraising stories you haven’t mentioned yet?</strong></h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ffatemi21/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Faraz</a></strong> from Lightspeed had reached out to me on Twitter, LinkedIn, and email countless times, but I ignored all of them. I didn’t even read the emails; I just marked them as done.&nbsp;</p><p>Then they got creative. For any VCs, here’s a tip: they invited me to a founder's dinner in LA. At the time we were a remote company and I was spending 14 hours a day working alone.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought, “you know what? Meeting some other founders in LA sounds nice.”</p><p>After I agreed to attend, they suggested meeting for coffee first. I realized I’d been tricked, but I decided to go along with it since I was already planning to go to the dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>The call went well, and I did my usual thing — I added them to our investor update list.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t want to keep giving them personalized updates, so I told them they’d get the same monthly update everyone else received, which would provide more detail than any 30-minute call could.</p><p>They stayed on that update list for 3 to 4 months. When I decided to raise a Series A, Lightspeed was on my shortlist since they had already shown a lot of interest.&nbsp;</p><p>I sent them an email, and because they had 4 months of context from those updates, they were ready to commit immediately. We had a term sheet within 4 to 5 days.</p><h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2><h3><strong>What’s one piece of fundraising advice you’d give other founders?</strong></h3><p>Having leverage is so important as a founder.</p><p>Our Series A was the closest to “needing” to raise we’ve dealt with yet.</p><p>There was a perfectly fine path forward of cutting our marketing spend and stretching it out until we turned it around or had better revenue before we ramped up.</p><p>For our Series B, we had over $10M in the bank and when we got our term sheet I said this isn't even close to what we're looking for and I have 0 urgency to take any deal in this situation.</p><p>We had $10M in the bank. We were totally good.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew the fork in the road where we could have accelerated and I did prefer that route.</p><p>That’s why we eventually got the terms that we liked and took a deal. But having leverage is the name of the game as a founder.</p><h3><strong>Who’s an investor you’d recommend other founders work with?</strong></h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasha-kaletsky-48a10378/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Sasha</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.creator.ventures/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Creator Ventures</a></strong>. He participated in our seed, and when the market turned during our seed extension round, no one was investing.</p><p>Sasha stuck his neck out and told me he’d put together our seed extension round. He got his LPs involved and led the charge there.</p><p>Also, when we were hiring a VP of Finance, I had not hired one of these before, and Sasha inserted himself into our hiring process and told me to send him all the resumes and ran the interview process himself.</p><p>He’s punched well above his weight, Sasha is a legend.</p><h3><strong>Are there any resources you’d recommend to other founders?</strong></h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Thinking Fast and Slow</a></strong>. It’s more of a psychology book, but I think everything in the world comes down to understanding human psychology.&nbsp;</p><p>As a founder, having a good understanding of how to leverage that to your advantage is super powerful.</p><p>Also, sign up for <strong><a href="https://www.bigdeskenergy.com/?utm_source=foundingjourney.com&amp;utm_medium=referral">Big Desk Energy</a></strong>, my newsletter!&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly sending investor updates is so powerful (even before you have investors).</p><p>There are so many things happening at once. For me, the investor update is the way to get all my thoughts on paper.</p><p>Forcing yourself to be accountable and write that every month is both extremely clarifying for you and the team, but it’s also an opportunity to show investors how you think about the business.&nbsp;</p><p>This will do so much more than a pitch deck can do.</p><h3><strong>Do you have any hot takes regarding the fundraising process?</strong></h3><p>I think there are so many fallacies that companies use as accepted truths that I don't think are real.&nbsp;</p><p>They’ll say things like, now that we are 80 people, we need to hire that VP, and then we need to implement a process and now we need to add this new process that didn't exist before.</p><p>There's a lot of accepted things that companies think they should do as they get larger.</p><p>One of those is that we have $40M in the bank so any problem that we have we can be solved by hiring someone to tackle that problem. I reject that.</p><p>I'm on the other end of the spectrum which is maybe too extreme. I prefer no managers and just having a flat org where everyone knows what they're responsible for.</p><p>I don't want to fall into the trap of having money, and thinking that we can do things that larger companies do. I want to continue to ship and operate as if we're a 5 person startup.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>How We Can Help</strong></h2><h3><strong>Content Creation</strong></h3><p>Let my team and I <a href="https://s665g04yp0s.typeform.com/to/rOXjvxHU">ghostwrite</a> for your newsletter, X, or LinkedIn.</p><h3><strong>Growth</strong></h3><p><a href="https://go.houck.news/megaphone">Grow your audience + generate leads</a> with my growth service.</p><h3><strong>Fundraising</strong></h3><p><a href="https://go.houck.news/fundraise">Share your round</a> with hundreds of investors in my personal network.</p><h3><strong>Advising</strong></h3><p><a href="https://go.houck.news/advising">I’ll help solve</a> a specific challenge you’re facing with your startup.</p><p>Advertise in my newsletter to <a href="https://go.houck.news/partner">get in front of 60,000+ founders</a>.</p></body></html>	The founder of beehiiv, Tyler Denk, shares his fundraising journey, emphasizing the importance of leverage and investor strategy.	2024-10-12 14:50:50	2024-10-14 07:37:25.244	2024-10-14 09:30:45.381	{vc}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4af84051-30dc-4b81-8de1-df0cfa71b7c8_430x377.png	Michael Houck	fundraising-case-study-beehiiv

The big news in CPG from this past week was BetterBrand, which produces high protein bagels and once valued at $176 million, seems to be in trouble. They delivered moldy products, unfulfilled many orders to customers and a few rumors ranging fromtheir founder/CEO is hiding out in Europe, to they’re shutting down or going through a hostile takeover. <a href="https://www.snaxshot.com/p/is-better-brand-shutting-down-company">Snaxshot has the story.</a></p><p>Last year, BetterBrand raised a $6 million Series A at a pre-money valuation of $170 million. What I didn’t understand at the time was why at that valuation you’re only raising $6 million. That’s only diluting less than 3.5% of the company. For a Series A, that’s a VERY small percentage. The commentary was focused on the pre-valuation number (which was BIG), not the amount raised number. After I read it last year, I texted an investor friend and told him I was puzzled and didn’t get it. He didn’t quite understand it either and thought of some situations. But the situations didn’t sound like normal situations. If anyone has reasons why this would happen in any deal (only dilute less than 3.5% of the business in the Series A), I’d love to hear them.</p><p>On to the consumer news of the week &amp; events for this month.</p><h2>This Week In Consumer</h2><h2>🧃Consumer Brands👚</h2><h4>💰Fundraises💰</h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.sofiepavittface.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopBRH_Tu_3qdb9wfC6w1MDoY7_gZt8x2Cyo9CWx9t16m7TsOvlq">Sofie Pavitt Face</a>, the skin-care brand founded by aesthetician Sofie Pavitt, has secured seed funding from True Beauty Ventures.

Founded in 2023, Avra runs a selective program for the world’s best growth-stage entrepreneurs. It helps the leaders of breakout businesses learn how to build an executive team, maintain shipping speed, and plan for the future. It’s a kind of doctoral program for startup CEOs, albeit one with a well-guarded curriculum and a venture fund on the back end.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning from Y Combinator</strong>. Avra’s team previously worked together at YC Continuity, the growth practice of the famed accelerator. When YC suddenly shuttered that division in March 2023, Avra founder Anu Hariharan put her plans for a new growth program into high gear, bringing colleagues with her.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>A missing piece</strong>. Though YC is still recognized as the best launchpad for early-stage startups, it has competition from dozens of other incubators and accelerators. Avra is the first of its kind: a high-quality standalone program for post-Series A companies. As a result, the fund has the opportunity to establish itself as a standard bearer for later stage startups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tactical masterclasses</strong>. Avra’s program is taught by some of the startup ecosystem’s most impressive and successful founders. Sessions cover choosing the right metrics, hiring executives, scaling engineering, leveling up financial planning, and preparing for future fundraises. Each one is a tactical masterclass full of detail.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Reordering VC</strong>. Though Avra’s principal mission is to assist founders through targeted education, it monetizes as a venture firm. It is raising a reported $350 million to invest in a small fraction of the startups that pass through its program. It’s a clever strategy that reorders the traditional sequence venture capital follows. Rather than winning a deal and <em>then </em>adding value, Avra does the work upfront, proving its impact and building rapport ahead of a future round.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Benedict Evans, analyst and erstwhile investor, once referred to Andreessen Horowitz as “a media company that monetizes through VC.” It was a pithy description of his former employer that got to the heart of the firm’s forceful brand building strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra Capital is a trade school that monetizes through VC.&nbsp;</p><p>In almost all of its core functionality, Avra appears to be a small-batch institution of higher learning. It runs bi-annual cohorts, holds classes, doles out required reading, and assigns homework. What distinguishes Avra from other vocational programs is the trade that it teaches, and the student body it admits.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra is not focused on nursing, HVAC repair, or aeronautics but on the craft of company building. Its student body is made up of many of this generation’s most promising founders—the people behind some of the world’s hottest startups, vying to become tech’s next big winner.&nbsp;</p><p>All matriculate to learn directly from founders who have overcome the obstacles they currently face. Walk the imagined hallways of Avra Academy, and you’ll pass the bronze nameplates of its luminary educators: Professor Parker Conrad of Compound Software, Visiting Scholar Greg Schott of Enterprise Sales, and Dean Tony Xu, Head of Urban Scanning.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra’s top-tier instructors and effective playbook owe a great deal to the experience of its founder, Anu Hariharan. Starting in 2016, Hariharan ran Y Combinator’s Growth team, backing companies like Brex, Monzo, Gusto, Zepto, Groww, Rappi and Faire. As part of that role, she and co-head Ali Rowghani managed the accelerator’s post-Series A program, designed to help breakout companies manage the next phase of their growth. When YC President Garry Tan abruptly shut down the division in March 2023, Hariharan and several colleagues used seven years of lessons to found Avra.&nbsp;</p><p>Given Hariharan’s bonafides and the quality of Avra’s instruction, it’s little wonder that attaining entrance to the fund’s program has grown increasingly competitive in just its first year of operation. The chance to attend small, tactical sessions with legendary entrepreneurs is attractive to many – not least when delivered in the vulnerable, off-the-record style that Avra encourages. It wants its students not simply to understand how DoorDash’s CEO recruits his C-Suite, for example, but to hear the mistakes and lessons learned along the way.</p><p>That frankness is why Avra guards the content of its curriculum so closely. It is one thing to ask a founder to regale an audience of junior peers with a parade of mistakes, quite another to make those battle scars visible to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps because of its combination of secrecy and cache, Avra (and YC Growth before it) represents a tantalizing prospect for outsiders. Visit its site, and you’ll find glowing testimonials from alumni but little in the way of tangible detail. How do great CEOs scale their engineering teams? What quirks enable tech companies to maintain a rapid shipping speed? In short, what does a school for super-scalers actually look like from the inside? What do exceptional founders know that the rest of us don’t?</p><p>Over the past nine months, The Generalist has been given unprecedented access to Avra’s program, experiencing it as a student might. That includes accessing its classes, program material, and alumni resources.</p><p>It proved an illuminating process, giving me insight into Avra’s unusual advantages in the venture landscape and a fiercer appreciation for the grit, guile, intensity, and consistency it takes to build a generational business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The making of a VC</h2><p>Anu Hariharan made her decision. After much deliberation and research, she’d elected to choose three promising growth-stage companies: online grocery delivery provider Instacart, travel marketplace GetYourGuide, and on-demand storage player MakeSpace.</p><p>It represented an unusual sort of investment decision—freighted by high stakes but with no money on the line. It was part of the interview process with a New York City hedge fund interested in venture investing—“you can probably easily guess who,” she says—and Hariharan had been tasked with pitching a trio of compelling Series B startups.</p><p>It was a tricky task for a former Qualcomm engineer and Boston Consulting Group principal with no venture capital experience and little familiarity with the tech landscape. “I didn’t even know what Series B was,” Hariharan recalled. “I didn’t know anything about startups. I didn’t even read TechCrunch.”</p><p>Eleven years later, we know that Hariharan picked well. Instacart was valued at <a href="https://equable.org/instacart-and-valuation-risk/#:~:text=The%20Series%20A%20round%20in,in%20a%20%24354%20million%20valuation.">$25.4 million</a> in its 2013 Series A; today, it trades at $9.5 billion. The Berlin-based GetYourGuide raised $194 million in debt and equity in 2023 at a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/travel-firm-getyourguide-raises-194-million-at-2-billion-valuation.html">$2 billion valuation</a>; it had raised approximately $20 million at the time Hariharan assessed it. Only MakeSpace can be considered a miss, merging with rival firm Clutter, which subsequently sold at a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/storage-startup-clutter-running-out-of-cash-sells-itself-at-steep-discount?rc=jtsqvx">steep discount</a> last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsure of her selections and eager for a more experienced opinion, Hariharan reached out to seasoned investors, asking for their advice. That act summarized Hariharan’s direct, unflappable approach to problem solving, and changed the course of her career.&nbsp;</p><p>“I sent cold emails to four VCs saying, “I’m interviewing at this fund, and I would love any feedback on the three companies I’ve picked to pitch,’” Hariharan recalled. “One of the people I emailed happened to be Jeff Jordan.”</p><p>As it turned out, Jordan was the perfect recipient for Hariharan’s message. Not only had he spent time at BCG before rising through the ranks at Disney, stepping in as President of PayPal, co-founding OpenTable and Wealthfront, and arriving at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), but he was also actively researching Instacart.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg" width="1200" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125501,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Anu Hariharan impressed Jeff Jordan to get a foothold in venture capital (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure></div><p>“I didn’t realize that he was diligencing them for the Series B,” Hariharan said. “He thought my diligence was pretty good and pretty interesting, so we started going back and forth on emails. And then he said, “Whenever you’re in San Francisco next, I’d love to meet you.”</p><p>Rather than leave the encounter to fate, Hariharan said she’d be in town the next week and booked a ticket. When she arrived at a16z’s office, Jordan surprised her with a few additions to her agenda. “I thought I was meeting just him, but he’d arranged eight meetings for me with everyone else at the firm,” Hariharan said.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, Hariharan was offered a job on a16z’s investment team. It marked the beginning of her venture career and the start of a breakneck education in a new kind of investing.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Hariharan had spent much of her time at BCG in the firm’s private equity practice, conducting detailed due diligence on potential investments, VC required her to adjust her perspective. “I had to recalibrate my thought process from PE to VC. After every pitch meeting, Jeff would ask me to articulate my point of view within five minutes. He also helped me focus on how to identify founders because so much of venture is about picking the right person.”</p><p>In addition to paying closer attention to entrepreneurs, Hariharan had to learn to let go of some of the conservatism her private equity experience had inculcated in her. A lunch meeting with firm co-founder Marc Andreessen encouraged her to focus more on a company’s potential than its risks.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was sometime around my nine-month mark at a16z,” Hariharan recalled. “He told me that usually, when he onboards someone, he has to teach them not to say yes to too many investments. But for me, he was going to have to teach me to say yes to one of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Andreessen told her that a VC’s biggest mistakes were ones of omission – the great companies that you should have invested in but didn’t. He urged Hariharan to apply her analytical brain to investigating a startup’s upside, developing the conviction to take a swing.&nbsp;</p><p>Hariharan cites Chris Dixon and Ben Horowitz as additional influences during this stage of her venture schooling. “Ben is exceptional at B2B SaaS – I learned a lot from how he dug into whether a sales team was working and the go-to-market metrics. Chris is just one of the most intelligent thesis-based investors I’ve ever seen.” Hariharan took lessons from both of them.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg" width="1024" height="684" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:684,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:474018,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Anu Hariharan learned from both Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz (Press Farm)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Although Hariharan may have been a greenhorn when it came to the venture asset class, she entered the industry with technical expertise, strategic experience, and a natural nose for investing. She tells the story of her entry into venture capital with deep humility – casting herself as a learner, above all else – but Hariharan’s fast rise is a testament to her talents. Spend even a few minutes with her, and you cannot help but notice her striking but unflashy intellect, a direct, genial speaking style, and substance. Her long-time colleague Nic Dardenne summarized Hariharan’s gifts eloquently. “There are two things: one, she works insanely hard. She’s an incredibly successful person but is also the hardest-working person I know, both for the team and the founders she works with. Two, she does right by founders. She has this superpower of telling people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear, but doing so in a way that endears herself to them and makes them trust her even more.”&nbsp;</p><p>Not long into her second year at a16z and another Silicon Valley institution had started noticing her talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Altman, then President of Y Combinator, had decided to launch a growth practice designed to double down on the accelerator’s best-performing businesses. He sought two general partners to run “YC Continuity,” with existing Managing Director Ali Rowghani—the former CFO and COO of Twitter—slated to step into one of those roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her relatively short tenure in venture, Hariharan had already made an impact on the YC community, developing a relationship with several of the ecosystem’s startups. “We worked with a lot of YC founders at Andreessen Horowitz,” she said. “One of YC’s partners pinged me and said they’d heard my name a lot and asked if I’d be open to having a conversation about the growth fund they were planning to launch.”&nbsp;</p><p>She was. Though Hariharan enjoyed her time at a16z, there was no path to a partner at the time – significant for someone who had been on the partner track at BCG. After she completed a two-year stint, she planned to step into an operating role at one of the firm’s portfolio companies. “I was on the path to be the CFO of one of the startups we’d invested in,” Hariharan reflected. “I never felt like I needed to be an investor. My goal is always around learning and impact. I thought, ‘Maybe I can go to a portfolio company and do that for four or five years.’”</p><p>Altman’s interest forced her to reconsider that plan. “YC is such an amazing place and a very differentiated platform,” Hariharan said. “I think it’s unlike any other VC. It’s <em>not</em> really a VC fund.” Over a few months, Hariharan got to know the team better, and by August 2016, she’d decided to join as YC Continuity’s second managing director.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Continuity</h2><p>Though Hariharan intended to stay four years at Y Combinator, she lasted seven. That duration is a consequence of the compelling power of YC’s platform, the value the Continuity practice created, and the abruptness with which it was shuttered.&nbsp;</p><p>But we should not rush ahead. When Hariharan joined Ali Rowghani in 2016, the pair were tasked with building out a new practice under the auspices of Y Combinator. In addition to functioning as a growth-stage investor, Continuity was expected to build a curriculum and operate a program of its own.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:73249,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Ali Rowghani, Hariharan's partner at YC Continuity (YC)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Much of that mission aligned with Y Combinator’s roots, of course. Ever since its founding in 2005, it had operated a de-facto “founder school,” teaching unseasoned founders how to build startups. Its syllabus – devised by Paul Graham and honed by countless partners and practitioners – accelerated the trajectories of companies like Reddit, Airbnb, Stripe, and Flexport.</p><p>Continuity would do the same, albeit for a different audience and with some critical tweaks. Rather than assisting scarcely-formed projects, it would work with established startups, rapidly scaling revenue and headcount. That contrasting focus necessitated changes to YC’s classic syllabus and the program's structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of serving 50, 100, or even 400 startups a batch, Continuity worked with 8-12. Rather than focusing on finding product-market fit, Hariharan and Rowghani counseled founders on scaling as CEOs, hiring executives, maintaining shipping speed, plowing through plateauing growth, and raising later-stage rounds. And because those topics require detailed tactical knowledge and emotional credibility, Continuity primarily relied on active founders – those still “in the arena” – to teach its courses. Plaid’s Zach Perret and Webflow’s Vlad Magalin both taught for Hariharan’s program.&nbsp;</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;45a535aa-6c85-4b73-b1b0-92df7ea8baaf&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The Generalist delivers in-depth analysis and insights on the world's most successful companies, executives, and technologies.

It didn’t hurt that the growth program stood alone in the competitive landscape. Although myriad accelerators like Techstars and 500 Startups had cropped up to vie for early-stage founders, no dominant program existed for scalers. “I don’t think anyone runs something similar,” Hariharan said. “Even now that I’m on the outside and have spent all this time learning about founder programs, I still haven’t found anyone who does it – at least not as well.”</p><p>In part, that’s because of the network and wisdom Continuity was able to glean from its parent company. “I think we learned the art of doing it well because we got to see how well YC did it for the early stage,” Hariharan reasoned. “It’s not easy to do without that.”</p><p>Though Continuity saw itself principally as an educator, it monetized like YC – via investments. Once again, it did so with a twist. While YC makes investment a requirement to participate – you cannot attend the program without accepting its “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=yc+standard+terms&amp;oq=yc+standard+terms&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Standard Deal</a>” – Continuity operated opportunistically, investing in a select number of companies only when the right moment arrived. Not only was this a logical reflection of later-stage funding rounds, but it also meant that companies that matriculated to Continuity did so with no strings attached. The vast majority of graduates never received capital from Hariharan and Rowghani; of the approximately 180 that went through the program, Continuity backed just a fraction of them.&nbsp;</p><p>As she had at a16z, Hariharan continued to learn from those around her, not least future OpenAI’s supreme leader, Sam Altman. In particular, Altman exhorted Hariharan to test her conviction and size bets aggressively. “Sam had this characteristic of asking, ‘Are you betting the house?’” Hariharan recalled. “It was his way of understanding if you had high conviction on an investment. Either you have full conviction, or you don’t. If you’re on the fence, why are you doing this? And if you have full conviction, why aren’t you doing more? It’s a simplistic framework, but I appreciate how much clarity it brings to investment decisions. That’s the biggest thing I learned from Sam.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg" width="437" height="656.7005494505495" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2188,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:437,&quot;bytes&quot;:11301954,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sam Altman ran Y Combinator when Hariharan first joined (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure></div><p>According to Hariharan, Altman’s heuristic made a noticeable difference on Continuity’s investing style over time. In its first fund, the growth team approached capital-intensive businesses cautiously, even if a large addressable market might have justified a bolder strategy. By its last fund, Continuity had learned to lean in. “We were a little gun shy when the risk was higher, but then by the third fund, we were more aggressive. When we saw Zepto, which is a 10-minute quick commerce player in India, we bet the house. It wasn’t clear it was going to be a breakout, but it is today.”</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;30ac103f-5e3e-4028-939d-37d3f9c1695a&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Actionable insights&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Y Combinator: The Institute of Innovation&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:9653721,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mario Gabriele&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Founder of The Generalist&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5007322-b272-4faa-9489-8f159a07e65a_1205x1297.jpeg&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:1000}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2022-07-17T21:27:53.509Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25281e3-b354-452d-a2cb-7fa9bb002e17_2700x2100.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/y-combinator-the-institute-of-innovation&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:64527490,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:10,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Generalist&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2dfe63cd-67ea-49ba-92df-930520a822a0_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p>Hariharan and Rowghani were not alone in making these investment decisions. Their growth practice grew to include Nic Dardenne, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, and Tiffany Kosolcharoen, who conducted market intelligence at Meta.&nbsp;</p><p>Dardenne operated as a traditional growth investor, albeit one with a particular gift for grasping a company’s financials. A colleague likened his role to that of a “mini CFO” for some of the companies he works with, helping to retool their models from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>Kosolcharoen served in a slightly different capacity. At Meta, she built out the market intelligence systems and conducted research for a portfolio of products. At&nbsp;YC Continuity, she was brought on as Head of Investment Research, tasked with monitoring the accelerator’s many companies and spotting candidates for additional capital. Through this process, Continuity quickly spotted the steep trajectory of startups like Deel and Zip before they raised Series A rounds. That allowed the Continuity team to build a relationship and lead later investments.&nbsp;</p><p>Over Continuity’s seven-year run, it pulled together a promising portfolio, many of which have repaid its investment many times over. Hariharan and Rowghani’s prominent bets include Stripe, Coinbase, Faire, Monzo, Groww, Vanta, Segment, Rappi, Gusto, and Brex. Naturally, not all have been hits – in October 2023, trucking firm Convoy, a Continuity investment, shut down operations after consuming over $1 billion in capital. Nevertheless, on balance, Hariharan’s team seems to have done remarkably well. “My hope is that in time, we’ll show that we had one of the best growth track records during that period,” Tiffany Kosolcharoen said.&nbsp;</p><p>Brex represented a particularly significant investment for Hariharan. Not only did she preempt a pricey Series B round for a company that had little revenue in 2018 – a decision that was spectacularly vindicated in the following years—but she also found a future colleague.&nbsp;</p><p>Serving on Brex’s board introduced her to Lucas Fox, an early employee who would go on to manage its startup business unit. The pair became frequent collaborators, with Fox struck by the intensity with which Hariharan was willing to graft on behalf of the company. “She was almost like an exec at Brex. We worked really closely together – we’d go on three-to-five-day work binges when we were trying to solve a problem together.” Sometimes, when Fox was tackling a particularly thorny issue, he’d stay at Hariharan’s family home for days at a time.&nbsp;</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;6fe9f735-c1ae-48cc-870d-43eb7bacf300&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The Generalist delivers in-depth analysis and insights on the world's most successful companies, executives, and technologies.

One founder who went through the course described it as “one of the most valuable things I’ve done as a CEO.” Overall, YC’s growth program earned an NPS of 70+ from founders, an illustration of the esteem in which it was held.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which made its sudden demise even more startling.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>The last job</h2><p>If there was one source of friction between Anu Hariharan and Y Combinator, one wasp at the picnic, this was it. The accelerator wanted Continuity to invest <em>only </em>in startups that had gone through its early-stage program. Its mission was to prepare YC alumni for the next phase of growth and build greater ownership in their businesses, not accelerate the best growth founders, no matter what their provenance.&nbsp;</p><p>It marked a philosophical difference between Hariharan and her employer. Though she understood that accepting non-YC companies presented a challenge – risking upsetting legacy founders in favor of newcomers, she considered it a surmountable one. “I actually told YC that maybe the program should include companies from the outside. Just like when you look at universities, there are two main entry points: undergraduate and graduate,” said Hariharan.&nbsp;</p><p>YC dabbled with the idea, allowing Continuity to back two external startups: British neobank Monzo and the ill-fated logistics company Convoy. Ultimately, though, it declined to continue the experiment, preferring to exclusively serve alumni.&nbsp;</p><p>Long before Hariharan joined Continuity or even a16z, she’d known that, at some point, she wanted to build a business of her own. “I’ve always had the itch to be an entrepreneur. I didn’t know whether I would start a company or a fund, but I knew that my last job could never be part of any platform.” The limitations on Continuity’s operations, added to the fact that she’d stayed at YC much longer than she’d anticipated, caused Hariharan to consider building something of her own.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of 2022, she’d written a “strategy letter” outlining the fund she planned to start. It would be a firm influenced by the impact of YC Continuity but available to all founders. “I thought that what we built at YC was awesome, and I really wanted to continue that work,” Hariharan explained. “Barring a few, growth investing on the outside is done so poorly. It’s done lazily. Everyone thinks, “Oh, these companies have their Series A, that’s enough. They have $5-15 million in revenue; they don’t need support.’ That’s <em>absolutely</em> not true. I felt there was an opportunity to do this really well, inspired by all the YC principles I learned, but to do it differently.”</p><p>There’s a long-standing joke in the Hariharan family: every financial recession comes for Anu. She graduated college in the wake of the dotcom crash, then received her MBA amidst the wreckage of the global financial crisis. But as America flirted with another downturn at the start of 2023 and Silicon Valley weathered a banking crisis, the Hariharans were uncommonly sanguine. “My family thought, ‘Oh, in 2023, Anu is safe; she has so many years of experience,’” Hariharan says with a chuckle. “And then, of everyone in the family, I was the only one without a job.”&nbsp;</p><p>The defenestration of Hariharan, Rowghani, and the rest of the Continuity team was swift. On March 13, 2023, <em>The Information </em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/y-combinator-to-end-late-stage-startup-continuity-fund?rc=jtsqvx">reported</a> that new YC president Garry Tan had decided to close the firm’s growth practice as part of a push to refocus the accelerator. “Late-stage investing turned out to be so different from early-stage investing that we found it to be a distraction from our core mission,” Tan told <em>The Information</em> at the time.</p><p>It came as a jolt to Hariharan. Though she’d laid the groundwork for a new fund, she hadn’t expected to take the jump until 2024 at the earliest. Now, the transition had been thrust upon her. “It was hard, she said. “We had to take care of the whole team. It was a huge shock to them.” At the time of Tan’s announcement, Continuity still had $500 million in capital left to invest.&nbsp;</p><p>It caught many prominent alumni off-guard, too, with at least ten startups <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/garry-tans-first-big-move-as-y-combinator-ceo-roils-founders?rc=jtsqvx">expressing</a> in a letter to YC that they were “surprised and deeply disappointed” by a decision that impacted the composition of their boards. Signatories included the founders of Brex, Deel, Rappi, Zepto, Convoy, and Monzo.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;30b28a68-435b-4ba1-ac8d-e1a826be769c&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Actionable insights&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rappi: The One Who Knocks&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:9653721,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mario Gabriele&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Founder of The Generalist&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5007322-b272-4faa-9489-8f159a07e65a_1205x1297.jpeg&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:1000}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2021-10-03T12:11:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e1d1cbf-4eec-4813-a906-308cd6f25b74_2700x2100.png&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/rappi-the-one-who-knocks&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:105811971,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:0,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Generalist&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2dfe63cd-67ea-49ba-92df-930520a822a0_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p>Though undoubtedly a blow to Hariharan and her team, it also presented an opportunity. “I had assumed I wasn’t going to take anyone with me from YC, which is why I’d started conversations with Lucas [Fox] ahead of time,” Hariharan said of the recently departed Brex employee. “Now, I could also get Nic [Dardenne] and Tiffany [Kosolcharoen] from day one, which meant there were many steps I could eliminate, and we could spring into action very quickly.”&nbsp;</p><p>By September 2023, seven months after Continuity’s closure, Avra Capital ran its first batch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The Avra academy</h2><p>Almost exactly a year after Avra launched its program, welcoming eleven companies into its cohort, it is wrapping up its third batch. In the intervening 12 months, Avra is reportedly honing in on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/former-yc-continuity-head-targets-350-million-growth-stage-fund/">$350 million</a> in capital, according to TechCrunch (Hariharan declined to comment on the matter). Andrew Davis, Managing Partner of Socium Ventures, shared his rationale for backing Avra’s debut vehicle:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The easiest way to gain conviction in Anu’s track record was by seeing how many of the founders and partners she worked with chose to be investors in [Avra]. I have partnered with Anu for many years, and she is one of the most impactful and ethical investors I’ve ever worked with. We couldn’t say ‘yes’ fast enough when she asked us.</p></blockquote><p>As well as winning over limited partners like Davis, Avra has also honed its curriculum, built intriguing in-house software, and impressed some of the world’s most coveted growth-stage founders. Entrants include European OpenAI challenger Mistral, creative platform Runway ML, GPU orchestration system Foundry, gaming device Backbone, and many others.</p><p>In devising Avra, Hariharan chose to build around a few key pillars – some inspired by YC Continuity, others in direct opposition:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Open to all.</strong> Since Avra is not part of an existing platform, it is free to accept any business it chooses without having to give preferential treatment to YC alumni. Places are given to the growth-stage firms Avra considers most promising.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Founder taught</strong>. Like YC Growth, Avra’s programs are taught by expert practitioners, typically tenured CEOs or VPs with domain expertise. These people have gone through the same challenges as Avra’s students and can speak with experience and authority.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Off-the-record</strong>. Many venture firms produce first-rate content for founders. However, when this information features advice from other entrepreneurs, it is inherently “on-the-record.” By keeping all of Avra’s sessions confidential, instructors are able to speak with greater vulnerability, specificity, and candor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Education-first</strong>. Avra sees itself as an educational offering first and a fund second. This is more than just marketing. The majority of the team’s time and focus is spent on improving its programming and associated offerings. The idea is that investment opportunities will naturally follow.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalized curriculum</strong>. Though growth companies face the same set of challenges – scaling executive teams and maintaining high throughput – they do not all experience them at the same time. Avra tries to ensure its sessions directly attack founders’ most pressing problems, as well as prepare them for the future.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>No strings attached</strong>. Admittance to the program is not predicated on Avra investing, either implicitly or explicitly. Founders understand that Avra monetizes as a venture firm but are not pressured to solicit them for future rounds. Hariharan’s team believes it will earn the opportunity by delivering value, not by making demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>These principles have guided the creation of the Avra apparatus, a machine that ingests thousands of startups but serves a select few. It is neither the slow, precious, boutique venture capital of the traditionalists nor does it adhere to Y Combinator’s industrialized model. It is something new, something in between – a processed, productized approach to small-batch brewing.</p><p>Before exploring its curriculum, it’s important to understand how it sits within Avra’s broader structure and sequencing. In total, its methodology is comprised of 8 critical steps:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg" width="1456" height="1132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1132,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:696378,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Step 1: Data-driven sourcing</h3><p>Avra scans tens of thousands of startups around the world through a bespoke early-detection system devised by Tiffany Kosolcharoen. Though it has a similar goal to the product Kosolocharoen built at YC Continuity – identifying breakout startups – it is being architected in a new technological era. “We get to reimagine it in the age of AI,” Kosolcharoen said. “The stack is being reinvented.”</p><p>The early-detection system tracks approximately 50,000 global startups between pre-seed and Series A, excluding Chinese businesses and those in sectors Avra feels unsuited to advise. Though the fund is generalist in approach, it steers clear of a few highly technical, specialized pockets like biotech.&nbsp;</p><p>Kosolcharoen and the broader team are tight-lipped about how exactly the system works but did share some of its key principles and a few example data sources. “There’s this large alternative data industry where hedge funds spend millions of dollars a year to acquire data sets. Through my past experiences, we’ve learned how to do it differently where we’re not spending that amount of money. We’re really looking at which metrics are leading versus lagging in breakout businesses,” Kosolcharoen explained. “For example, revenue might be a lagging indicator because it’s not necessarily the first metric that helps you identify a breakout business. The same is true of job openings – only after a company achieves a certain round of funding are they able to open up new positions.”</p><p>So, what data sources are actually leading? Lucas Fox highlighted the importance of tracking Github repositories and stars, Twitter trends, and engagement via platforms like Discord or other open-source communities. Avra’s system tracks the social activity of certain influential people – noting the new companies or entrepreneurs they follow. It also incorporates app traffic, web traffic, Hacker News upvotes, backlinks growth, and consumer credit card data. The system integrates qualitative signals, too, assessing the perceived quality of a founding team and the caliber of the company’s known cap table. In total, it tracks more than 50 custom sources to develop a sense of the current market.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this process, Avra filters 50,000 startups to a shortlist of a few hundred that it continuously monitors. Further screening relies on manual intervention and nuanced judgment. Kosolcharoen creates “competitive sets” for different industries as part of this process. The idea here is to parse the dynamics within a certain industry to allow for cleaner comparisons between players. “It’s a really controversial, contentious topic because every single person at a company defines their competitive set differently,” Kosolcharoen noted. “It’s about identifying the peer sets today and then going through the game theory to see who might be in that peer set in the future.”&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg" width="1456" height="762" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:762,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:699228,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The ultimate goal is to use this information to pick potential market winners. “There’s often a human angle to it, some product strategy, to identifying a category leader. You need to figure out which companies might converge onto each other,” Kosolcharoen clarified. “That’s a challenge if you anchor only on alternative data. The product roadmap and product strategy of a company doesn’t exist in a data format. You need a combination of looking at the data and the strategy to identify which companies may be inflecting among their peer set.”&nbsp;</p><p>For example, an analysis of the neobanking space would not only compare Nubank, Revolut, Chime, Monzo, and dozens of other consumer offerings. It would have highlighted the potential for neobrokers like Robinhood and Public to make a play for the space, for B2B offerings like Mercury and Brex to try and win over consumers, for rent rewards-focused cards like Bilt to extend outward, and for stablecoin-based products like DolarApp to win with new rails.&nbsp;</p><p>According to attendees of Avra's program, Kosolcharoen has a gift for this process. “She’s extremely talented at understanding business models,” Joseph Nelson, CEO of Roboflow, said. “When you have tactical questions around positioning, or what’s going on in your space, she can not only talk about it in terms of what makes sense strategically but also what’s playing out in the sector and how you should think about it as a result.”&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the 37 companies that have attended the program so far, it’s evident that Avra’s system has identified non-obvious candidates alongside some of the buzzy names previously mentioned.</p><p>Anu Hariharan cited Clerk.dev as an example of Avra’s quantitative sourcing at work. Its system flagged the user management platform’s spiking sign-ups and encouraged Avra to reach out. In its second batch, Hariharan estimates that Kosolcharoen’s system helped select approximately 60% of the companies. Avra has also invited companies headquartered in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, France, and Sweden – not entrepreneurial backwaters, but some way behind the USA.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg" width="1456" height="1132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1132,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:726270,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Before it gets to the invitation stage, Avra conducts further filtering. It cannot reasonably meet with hundreds of companies; instead, it watches them over time and looks for inflection points followed by consistent growth. “We do week-over-week monitoring. That’s how we know which ones are taking off,” Hariharan said. “The key is to measure it dynamically. Pretty easily, you get to a top 50 because not everyone is growing week-over-week.”</p><p>Finally, Avra does external diligence to cut its top 50 down to 20 finalists. It conducts further research, speaks to customers, assesses the logos they’ve succeeded in signing up, and asks its community of founders for comment. “Our alums often say, ‘Talk to these people, don’t talk to those ones.’ They help us narrow down the list and also add founders we might have missed,’” Hariharan said. “They’ll say, ‘Hey, this company might not be on your radar because they just raised a seed and haven’t announced it, but they need to be on your list.’”&nbsp;</p><p>These referrals are a critical part of Avra’s sourcing process. Founders are often excellent judges of talent and early adopters of new, disruptive technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Nic Dardenne, Avra is already benefiting from this process. “For our second batch, we were able to get 20-30 recommendations from founders that went through the first batch or had previous relationships with,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Hariharan noted that Anyscale (Avra Batch 2), an AI compute platform, had been referred by RunwayML’s CEO, Cris Valenzuela (Avra Batch 1). Similarly, Clair (Avra Batch 2), the provider of earned wage access solutions, came thanks to a recommendation from Plaid’s Zach Perret (YC Growth). “Clair actually hadn’t come up on our radar because they were just breaking out,” Hariharan said. “Zach said that we should really talk to them.”</p><h3>Step 2: One-on-one evaluations</h3><p>Once Avra has identified 20 finalists, it contacts them for a meeting. Before getting to the meetings themselves and what the fund is looking for, it’s worth highlighting an advantage Avra has in this outreach compared to traditional venture firms.</p><p>Hot companies are constantly warding off investors; garlic, crucifix, and terse email responses at the ready. Any startup the market sees as a potential breakout receives a steady drip of inbound interest, requests for casual coffee chats, and suggestions of pre-emptive financing. Though the first such offers may be flattering, they quickly become distracting, which is why so many CEOs shut them down with a simple: “heads down building, will circle back when we raise next.”</p><p>Because Avra offers a specific, differentiated product, it is able to sidestep this tripwire. When a member of the investment team reaches out to a startup CEO, it is not asking to invest; it is <em>offering </em>something of value. Especially when this pitch comes via a founder who enjoyed the program, it’s a powerful sell.&nbsp;</p><p>During its meetings with founders, Avra seeks to better understand the stage of the company and the capabilities of the founder. Three characteristics are particularly important:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Revenue threshold</strong>. Avra’s program is explicitly designed for growth-stage companies. If a company hasn’t achieved meaningful revenue, it may be better for them to wait for a later batch. “If you haven’t gotten to $2 million in annual revenue, it doesn’t make sense to do the program because it is not a good use of their time,” Hariharan said.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Scaling speed</strong>. As well as surpassing a certain threshold, Avra also looks to ensure a startup is growing rapidly. Much of Avra’s program focuses on building large, performant teams at hyper-speed, something a more modestly growing company may not need. “If you’re not scaling really fast in terms of revenue growth, you shouldnt be scaling your team,” Hariharan added.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>A self-aware CEO.</strong> “I’ve had the privilege of working with a lot of really good founders, and they’re <em>very</em> self-aware,” Hariharan explained. “It’s almost a signal we’re testing for because we don’t want founders who feel like they know everything. It won’t work for us, and over the long term, we have learned it does not work well for the company.” Avra looks for CEOs that understand their strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Is it difficult to gauge self-awareness? Avra seems to find it straightforward, asking a series of questions that force introspection. A few examples:</p><ul><li><p>What’s energizing about your job? What’s draining?</p></li><li><p>What are three things you’re good at? What are three things you suck at?</p></li><li><p>What are the strengths of your leadership team?</p></li><li><p>How well do you think you’ve hired?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>These questions, and others like them, provide a window into how founders have solved problems and their current assessment of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Avra can’t invite every founder it meets with, cutting its 20 finalists down to a 10-12 company batch. So far, almost every company Hariharan has invited has accepted despite the commitment it requires.&nbsp; “The take-up is very high,” Hariharan said. According to Avra’s founder, only one company chose not to attend Batch 1 for timing reasons.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 3: Kick-off retreat</h3><p>To create an environment in which founders feel comfortable sharing their challenges and failures, Avra kicks off each batch with an in-person retreat in Santa Rosa, California. This is a time for attendees to get to know one another and build context on each other’s businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s exceptionally helpful in setting the stage,” Roboflow’s Nelson said. “People share what’s working and not working inside their companies.” Vojta Drmota, CEO of Momence, shared a similar opinion: “You get to know the other founders on a personal level. There is no substitute for understanding who founders are and learning about their journey. That bond is really important for the rest of the program.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:252570,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Roboflow's founders, Joseph Nelson and Brad Dwyer (Roboflow)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Avra works to build rapport through structured exercises. “It feels kind of like a summer-camp-manufactured-fun kind of vibe,” Joseph Nelson said. “But it actually kind of works and makes you feel more relaxed with your peers. It establishes trust and candor amongst people in the program.”</p><p>Much of the retreat’s value occurs outside these team-building activities. “A big piece of it is just bringing people together,” Nic Dardenne explained. “It gives them a space away from their companies, away from their day-to-day, away from their laptop. It’s just free time to be able to connect.”</p><h3>Step 4: Classes</h3><p>The reason Avra invests in creating rapport between batchmates is because it wants its classes to be discussion groups, not lectures. “A lot of the value comes from founders sharing their problems, not just from the instructors,” Nic Dardenne remarked. “You need it not to be a one-to-many lecture. People have to feel comfortable sharing and being more vulnerable.”</p><p>Avra’s core curriculum is composed of 7 classes. Hariharan has asked that we not name the instructors so that we can share their takeaways while respecting the off-the-record nature of the sessions. These are Avra’s classes, in sequence:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Executive hiring and management (taught by two CEOs)</p></li><li><p>Mission, strategy, and metrics (taught by two CEOs)</p></li><li><p>Leading leaders (taught by public market CEO)</p></li><li><p>Operating cadence (taught by a CEO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Scaling engineering (taught by two CTOs)</p></li><li><p>Scaling people management (taught by a CEO and former VP of People)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Financial Planning and fundraising (taught by a CFO)&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Before each session, students are tasked with “pre-reading,” which usually takes a couple of hours to consume. They may also be prompted to reflect on the topic and tell the Avra team what they’re particularly keen to learn about, creating a more tailored program. Lucas Fox gave an example of how this works. “Ahead of our ‘Leading leaders’ session in Batch 2, we spent five minutes with each founder ahead of time really understanding the number one bottlenecks each of them had as it relates to people management. Out of 12 CEOs, we got 12 pressing problems. And then, on the call with the instructor, we just went one by one, asking, ‘How would you tackle this? How would you think about this?’ It’s very tactical. It’s not a general talk.”</p><p>The sessions themselves last approximately 90 minutes. Hariharan plays the role of interlocutor for instructors, prompting them to talk about certain experiences, share certain frameworks, or respond to questions. Her expertise is obvious in this role. It’s clear not only that she knows the stories of the instructors’ companies intimately, able to perfectly poke and prod, but that she also understands what is likely to be most valuable to growth-stage startups. As teachers share their experiences, students frequently chime in with questions or comments of their own. Magical moments occur when multiple CEOs – both those in the program and those teaching it – weigh in on a given subject, explaining how their company handles executive compensation or engineering structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul Copplestone, CEO of Supabase, highlighted the value of the discussions. “It’s super useful. And Anu is very good at prodding the instructors further. ‘What were the mistakes you made at this stage? Who did you hire? How many hours did you spend with executive recruits? What was your process?’ Anu’s constantly pulling them back to our stage – and maybe one step ahead. These topics are pretty timeless. There are all sorts of little tricks that founders have learned over the years. This is a way for them to pass that knowledge along.”</p><p>For RunwayML’s Cris Valenzuela, the value of the sessions was less in picking up specific tips and more in hearing the thinking process of exceptional CEOs. “I’m less a fan of instructions and recipes and rules that you can follow,” he said. “I’m more interested in intuition and how people make decisions. You can learn a lot by hearing how successful companies have been built and the decisions people took along the way. That’s the exposure I wanted. It wasn’t about getting something particular out of it, more of a way of thinking about how to tackle specific problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>Going through the experience together is another critical part of its value. “The reason the CEO job feels so lonely is because you’re grappling with things you’ve never dealt with before,” Hex founder Barry McCardel explained. “One of the few salves for it is knowing that the problems you’re facing are very common. When you go through a program like this, you get to talk to folks who are a few phases ahead and went through the same things you’re going through. You get to talk to other founders who have the same thoughts as you do. And they reaffirm for you that, yes, it is hard. And no, you’re not an idiot for struggling with it. It’s really helpful. It gets you out of your head and lets you zero in on the task at hand.”</p><h3>Step 5: Office hours</h3><p>In tandem with classes, Avra offers weekly office hours. These are an opportunity for founders to reflect on recent sessions and talk through their particular problems in greater detail.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re super useful,” Paul Copplestone said, citing their impact on leveling up Supabase’s financials as part of Avra’s push for the company to create a “mini S-1” (more in a moment). “The mini S-1 project makes you think a lot and forces you to ask a lot of questions. Without the office hours, I would have been floundering a bit, especially around knowing how to write up our financials. The Avra team literally built spreadsheets for us, which I now use for our investors.”</p><p>Momence CEO Vojta Drmota also found the added attention of office hours valuable. “In between sessions we would meet with Anu and her team. It supplemented the sessions very well because it was more pointed toward where Momence is now and what we need to focus on.”</p><p>For Avra as an investor, office hours are another chance to diligence companies close up. Founders openly talk about their thorniest problems and discuss how they’re thinking about solving them. Avra then gets to observe how quickly and effectively they test different solutions and land on the correct answer. Though most growth VCs get to know potential investments over a long period of time (at least six months and usually a year) to create a longitudinal view of their progress, Avra gets to witness it up close and unvarnished.</p><p>Hariharan highlighted how valuable it is to see founders address problems in real time. “How fast you move is very important. How long is a founder sitting on a certain decision? Do they have tight feedback loops, and are they course-correcting quickly? What frameworks are they using? Do they get stuck by brick walls, or do they know how to run through them?”</p><h3>Step 6: Mini S-1</h3><p>Avra’s batch culminates with an exercise: writing a “mini” S-1 filing. The goal is for founders to understand how their business fits into the broader corporate landscape, learn how public market investors value comparable companies, reflect on the core drivers of their current success, and sketch a blueprint for life as a public business.&nbsp;</p><p>Vojta Drmota outlined the process and its value. “It teaches you to present your business in a structured fashion. That’s something you don’t do as a private company on a regular basis. You write investor updates, but this is a much more detailed format. That’s very helpful, in and of itself,” he said. “Another key part of it is that in the S-1, you have to explain to an investor the $10 billion, $50 billion, or $100 billion outcome. You have to indicate where the company can go to impress upon investors that it’s a worthy investment. That’s not something you really think about as a founder. You think about, ‘How do I get to the $15 million revenue mark? How do I get to the $25 million mark?’ You rarely think about how you get to $5 billion or $10 billion.”&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking in those terms forces a level of bottom-up analysis that many startups don’t prioritize early in their lives. “You have to articulate what the best case scenario for your TAM is, what your market share has to look like, and what ACVs have to look like,” Drmota said. “It forces you to think not just about your mission but how it can be materialized.”&nbsp;</p><p>Founders rely on help from Avra and feedback from their batchmates to craft their S-1, which they eventually present in front of prominent public market investors. “It’s definitely an interesting process,” Cris Valenzuela said. “You learn a lot just by doing it, but you also get a lot because you speak with other people about it and get feedback. It helps you understand the future things you should be thinking about. I’d never done it before.”&nbsp;</p><p>Anu Hariharan consistently and earnestly emphasizes that office hours and the mini S-1 exercise are done to serve founders. There is no doubting the sincerity of that suggestion. The pragmatists among you cannot help but notice the advantages these exercises grant Avra the investor. From that vantage, the S-1 exercise asks founders to diligence themselves, presenting their findings and future growth for review. In essence, they are creating a pitch – stuffed with detail, risks, and opportunities. This exercise would not work if founders didn’t find it valuable; a happy byproduct is that it doubles as investment research.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 7: Private wiki</h3><p>If a YC alum needs a question answered, there’s a good chance they’ll post on Bookface. That’s the name for the accelerator’s private site featuring a discussion forum, investor ratings, a library of resources, and various perks.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra is building its own version of that resource, designed for growth-stage entrepreneurs. For now, the private wiki is barebones but already intriguing. It features a directory of the 42 founders who have attended Avra’s program, access to a private off-the-record podcast, and a wiki that documents key lessons from across the curriculum. Visit the page for “Leading leaders,” for example, and you’ll find well-structured notes gleaned from the associated session. Over time, Avra plans to add to these pages, creating a repository of high-quality information that helps founders during the program and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s exciting to envision what form this might take. As well as incorporating expertise from multiple CEOs over time in a given page, Avra could also collect collateral from different entrepreneurs. Sometimes, simply seeing how a founder lays out their hiring process on the page, or builds their board deck, can make a tangible difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Roboflow’s Nelson hopes Avra facilitates more of this resource sharing. “I think there are probably ways to grease the wheels and make sharing resources more commonplace. For example, making companies more comfortable walking through recent board decks and trading ideas. You can only do that when you have a close relationship.”&nbsp;</p><p>As the trusted connection between its instructors and students, Avra is positioned to act as the hub for this information. In time, growth-stage founders may want to join Hariharan’s community as much to access this library as to attend its course.</p><h3>Step 8: Alumni sessions&nbsp;</h3><p>Though Avra’s program culminates with the mini S-1 exercise, the firm’s relationship with founders continues beyond it. As well as continually adding new resources to its wiki, Avra holds alumni sessions and an off-the-record podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no real difference between these two products. Both feature Hariharan holding a conversation with a prominent founder, operator, or technologist, using her expert prodding to deftly direct the discussion. Past sessions have given founders an opportunity to learn about AI from a long-time expert, hear about a remarkable public market turnaround, and discover how an external CEO rescued a flagging unicorn from collapse. The idea of the podcast is to inspire founders during their most difficult times.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1367294,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Avra's alumni sessions can be used to address episodic challenges, like the shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Alumni sessions are an effective way for Avra to augment founders’ education and address transient issues. For example, had Avra existed during the Silicon Valley Bank catastrophe, it would have been well-positioned to put together a rapid response session, pulling in experts from relevant fields. As funding ebbs and flows and disruptive technologies like AI change the game on the field, this ongoing education is extremely valuable.&nbsp;</p><h2>Class is in session</h2><p>The hours I spent with Avra’s curriculum were among my highest-leverage of the year. In the course of a cumulative 12 hours, I learned how some of the world’s best CEOs manage their recruiting, financials, engineering teams, and fundraises. I heard of common mistakes, near-death experiences, and miraculous turnarounds.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which is why I’m extremely excited that Avra has allowed The Generalist to share takeaways from the program. To be clear, these are just the tip of the iceberg. Each session is packed with fascinating insights – some obvious in their value, others more subtle.&nbsp;</p><p>When Hariharan pitches the program to founders, she tells them they will receive direction in three areas:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Executive hiring and management</p></li><li><p>Shipping fast as you scale</p></li><li><p>Execution and clarity of thought</p></li></ol><p>Rather than walk through all seven sessions, we’ve distilled impactful pieces of advice from the entire curriculum that fit those categories.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, to respect the confidentiality of the instructors, we’ve kept them anonymous and stayed clear of identifying information. We’ve highlighted universal takeaways that stand alone and that we believe will be of greatest use to other founders.</p><h3>Focus 1: Executive hiring and management</h3><p>To scale your company, you must learn to hire exceptional people with capabilities that surpass your own in at least one dimension. Though founders are used to pinch-hitting across functions in a startup’s early days, winning in the growth phase necessitates finding and converting executives who can take your company to the next step.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Executive hiring success rate.</strong> A surprisingly large number of executive hires do not work out. Hex founder Barry McCardel cited this as particularly valuable information. “People will tell you that a good success rate for leadership hires is 60-70%. In reality, it’s closer to 50% for most companies, which is insane when you think about it. Hearing from other CEOs who are further along in their journey [was really helpful.]” Great executives surpass these levels. One CEO said that their last <em>15</em> executive hires had all worked out, an “exceptional” record.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t skip the references</strong>. It’s easy to skip out on referring executive hires earlier in your company’s life. Often, you might think you have enough information to make the call yourself. Don’t take this shortcut. One instructor said that 30% of the team references revealed a piece of critical information about a recruit. When you conduct references, ask the reference to score the person out of 10. Anything below a ‘9’ should be considered a poor score.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Take a “breadth-first” approach to the executive search</strong>. A common cause of a failed hire is not knowing the profile of the person you’re recruiting for. To prevent that from happening, conduct a “breadth-first” search in which you speak to different “flavors” of the role you’re hiring for. For example, if you’re recruiting a CFO, talk to one with more of an accounting background, one that’s more FP&amp;A oriented, and one that focuses on strategic finance to see which feels like the best fit. When you find the right person, be aggressive in winning them. “Elite founders don’t lose candidates,” was one CEO’s mantra.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest heavily in executive onboarding</strong>. When you succeed in hiring an executive, give them the tools to succeed. Align on the expectations for the role, and have <em>them</em> devise a plan for their first 30, 60, 90 days. (This is a place where you should lean on their functional expertise.) For the first 30-60 days, encourage them to spend as much time as possible simply learning about the organization rather than managing direct reports or producing work. For example, one incoming CEO conducted <em>80</em> one-on-ones and 20 group meetings before officially taking the reins. This is time well spent.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Proactively give raises to retain talent</strong>. Employees who scale alongside a startup often drastically increase their importance in a short amount of time. To avoid losing these people, give “out of band” pay increases when you notice their salary lags behind their impact. This will prevent them from feeling undervalued and looking for a new role. Additionally, one CEO recommends conducting stock refresher grants around the 2.5-year mark of an employee’s tenure as many consider their next move after about three years.</p></li></ol><h3>Focus 2: Shipping fast as you scale</h3><p>Founders often think their organization will accelerate as headcount increases. After all, can’t you achieve more with more people? It’s more common for the opposite to occur, at least in the short term. As your company scales, old processes break, the quality of new hires degrades, and coordination costs grow. Shipping fast as you scale requires an uncompromising mindset, intense work ethic, and sound strategy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Don’t accept “CEO in a box” trade-offs</strong>. Internal leaders will often come to you with either/or decisions: <em>you can either have a product built fast or with quality; which do you want?</em> One executive calls these “CEO in a box” trade-offs that should not be accepted. Why can’t a product be delivered quickly and with exceptional quality? It is almost always possible to avoid these false compromises.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>When troubleshooting, look for anecdotal evidence, not data</strong>. When a part of the organization is not working, it’s more useful to dig into transcripts or Slack messages than review high-level numbers. If the support team is lagging, read the last 25 tickets. If sales is underperforming, read the last 25 Gong recordings. You’ll spot patterns and get much deeper context than a dashboard can provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Commit to crazy</strong>. While attending an accelerator like YC, founders are pushed to their limits and operate at a frenzied pace. According to one CEO, when the program ends, most people revert to a much slower cadence. To build a legendary business, you cannot allow yourself to do this. Instead, you should be part of the few “crazy motherfuckers” that maintain that relentless speed. Working 20% more doesn’t yield a 20% productivity increase, according to this CEO; it delivers “way, way more.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Go slow to go fast</strong>. To build engineering teams that ship quickly, spend time upfront on two key areas: data modeling and core technology decisions. Both of these are difficult to change down the line, so think it through before committing. On a related note, consider introducing code reviews and tests from day one or close to it. Both will save you time in the long run and ensure you have strong engineering foundations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Break your engineering team into pods</strong>. As your company scales, you’ll need to manage an increasing number of engineers. Splitting people into arbitrary teams can drastically increase communication and coordination costs, slowing down shipping. One CTO outlines the approach his company uses, organizing itself into small 8-10 person “pods.” Pods are composed of 5-7 engineers, a PM, a designer, and a data scientist. Pods are given the context and resources they need to achieve their goals but are empowered to set their own strategy and to act as “small startups.”</p></li></ol><h3>Focus 3: Execution and clarity of thought</h3><p>In preparation for your Series B, take the time to look toward the future and build the systems you need to achieve your ultimate goals. Startups are constantly faced with urgent issues that require attention. You must proactively <em>make</em> time for non-urgent but still important subjects. In particular, make the effort to define your metrics, hone your messaging, and prepare for future raises.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Separate input and output metrics</strong>. Companies are used to focusing on “output” metrics like revenue or monthly active users (MAUs). Though this information is useful, especially for investors, it’s insufficiently actionable. What do you have to do <em>exactly</em> to grow MAUs? “Input” metrics are KPIs that help drive your output metrics and are more directly within your control. For example, to increase revenue as a food delivery company, you might set input metrics of order frequency and customer retention, as these could make an impact on your topline. Picking the right input metrics will require data analysis and deep consideration, but once you identify them, it’s much easier to direct your team’s efforts effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat your message consistently and frequently</strong>. Creating alignment across the organization requires you to restate your company’s mission, metrics, and strategy much more than you might expect. At least every week, you should re-communicate this to the company, using consistent language. Though it may seem like overkill, it’s critical to maintaining a common goal, refocusing different teams, and getting new hires up to speed.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Financial planning by confidence interval</strong>. As your company matures, building out a strategic financial department becomes essential. You will need a Head of Finance and, eventually, a CFO who can help you set realistic projections and plan for the future. Though setting goals often begins top-down, with a CEO outlining their ambitions, it should gradually become more bottom-up as the team scales and your processes become more predictable. Nevertheless, making perfect projections can be difficult for an organization that develops rapidly. One strategy is to plan for whatever period you have 70% confidence you can accurately forecast. This might be three months, six months, or a year. While this shouldn’t replace your annual planning, it ensures your forecasts don’t drift too out of line.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Lay the groundwork with investors</strong>. Growth-stage investors are writing larger checks, typically in the $20-100 million range. As a result, their process is longer and more detailed. To ensure you fundraise from a position of strength, identify 5-10 investors you believe would be suited to lead your next round and begin building relationships with them 6-12 months ahead of when you plan to raise. This gives VCs the opportunity to get to know you better, learn more about your model and market, and arrive to the fundraise with a prepared mind. It also allows you to vet potential partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Running a tight fundraise</strong>. If poorly managed, raising capital can take months or longer. You should drive investors to follow a 1-4 week diligence process. For that to happen, you must arrive prepared and equipped with a well-stocked data room. Once the process has begun, you should focus your attention on “high-signal investors” – namely, those that actually seem interested in your business. A good rule of thumb: “An interested investor tries to speed you up rather than slow you down.” When possible, use the momentum of other VCs to drive peers through the process.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Aberrant venture</h2><p>Venture capital, all of its theater and competition, can be condensed into six essential tasks:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Sourcing</strong>. To invest in a legendary company, you must find it first. Sourcing is the art of discovering as many high-quality opportunities as possible, ideally before your rivals.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Assessing</strong>. Once you’ve identified a potential investment, you must spend time diligencing it. At the growth stage, this often occurs over months or years of conversations and formal research.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Winning</strong>. Just because you have conviction in a startup does not mean you get to invest in it. Venture capitalists have to convince founders to <em>let</em> them buy shares, often over competitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investing</strong>. Though usually winning a deal results in an investment being made, they are theoretically distinct steps. Because of Avra’s model, and its quirks, it’s worth separating them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supporting</strong>. Not all VC firms want to help their portfolio companies, with some believing it to be a folly. Most do, however, assist with hiring, business development, future financing, and much more. This is the “adding value” phase that VCs market to the point of parody.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Exiting</strong>. To realize a return on an investment, VCs have to exit their position at some point. This may occur as a company enters the public markets, via an M&amp;A event, or through secondary sales.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Not only do these six tasks neatly summarize the work of a venture capitalist, but they also describe the sequence in which this style of investing occurs. Though there’s frequent overlap between them, each more or less operates as a distinct step in the process: you find a business, evaluate it, win it, “work” it, and sell it. It’s chronological and sequential.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects of Avra’s model is that it <em>rearranges</em> these steps to its own benefit. Though Avra starts by sourcing companies, it follows that stage by assessing, winning, and supporting a startup all at the same time. Its program compresses these three steps into one: Avra assesses a company as it adds value and, in doing so, preemptively wins the right to invest. Avra follows this process with all of its companies, including many it will not invest in. Only later on does it actually circle back and deploy capital.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg" width="1456" height="1123" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1123,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:785908,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s a meaningful twist on the venture model. Though investors and founders spend time getting to know one another and learning about each other’s businesses, there’s an unavoidable leap of faith made when entering into a partnership. A blustering dealmaker may spend months telling a CEO how they’ll win them customers, drive candidates to their doors, and broker introductions, only to disappear once the ink has dried. Another financier may extoll the virtues of an expansive in-house team and sophisticated software stack, open only to portfolio companies, and leave the entrepreneur with ineffectual help and vaporware.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Avra proactively frontloads its value-add, founders don’t have to worry about a bait-and-switch. Hariharan’s firm does not <em>tell </em>you how it can help; it <em>shows </em>you in vivid detail. When it comes to partnering, the leap of faith has been shortened into a puddle jump.&nbsp;</p><p>Several of the founders we spoke with expressed their interest in taking money from Avra despite the fact they were not actively fundraising. This is especially notable given that Hariharan’s firm works with many of the ecosystem’s hottest startups who have an abundance of funding options. “If we end up doing a round, I’ll definitely reach out to them,” Supabase’s Paul Copplestone said. “The most helpful and best investor in terms of helpfulness is definitely YC. I’d put Avra right next to them,” he added. “We’re not in a fundraising situation right now, so it’s hard to say, but I don’t see a reason why we wouldn’t reach out to them,” said Vojta Drmota. “I think it would be a strong yes.”</p><p>No venture investor can win every deal they want, of course, and though Avra has unique weapons, it also has weaknesses. “There are upsides and downsides of a new fund,” Joseph Nelson said. “One of the downsides is that a lot of the value for a fund is driving market awareness, whether that’s companies or candidates. That’s something I’m sure Avra is aware of. It’s just like a startup – you just have to offer to ensure you win a customer’s business.”&nbsp;</p><p>The early indications suggest that Avra’s product is doing a good job of winning founders’ business. So far, Hariharan has backed two companies, Zepto and Supabase, which <em>did </em>circle back to Avra a few months after our interview. Interestingly, Zepto is not a graduate of Avra’s program but a breakout business that YC Continuity previously backed. The fact that Avra participated in the grocery delivery company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/20/zepto-a-10-minute-delivery-app-raises-665-million-at-3-6-billion-valuation/">$665 million</a> Series F round illustrates its ability to be flexible and pragmatic, investing in the best opportunities for which it has a prepared mind.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp" width="1456" height="846" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:846,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:476058,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Avra invested in Zepto, a fast-commerce company in India (TechCrunch)</figcaption></figure></div><p>It also hints at a remaining opportunity Hariharan and her team intend to address: pre-IPO businesses. Just as growth-stage founders need dedicated help, Avra is convinced that CEOs heading for the public markets could benefit from tailored tutelage.&nbsp;</p><p>“The culmination of a great journey is becoming a public company,” Lucas Fox said. “There’s a reason the vast majority of the Fortune 500 is public – it comes with operational rigor, and there’s a lot of beauty and elegance in being a high-performing public business. We want to be able to partner with founders from the moment they start scaling through to the public markets.”</p><p>It would be a shrewd addition. For even exceptional startup founders, entering the public markets is a learning moment. It requires education and preparation, as well as the embrace of new rules and norms. Fox outlined what this program might look like: “We’ll invite companies that are 1-2 years from being public, and invite them to do a smaller program, probably on the weekends. We have alumni from the program that have already taken their companies public who can teach. We’ll separate it into certain modules, just like the current Avra program designed to help founders avoid common mistakes. It might talk about how to pick the right investment bank, structure your audited financials, or tell your story.”&nbsp;</p><p>By assisting founders at this stage, Avra would once again get a front-row seat to analyze them and could win the opportunity to invest ahead of a public debut. It’s an intriguing position in the capital stack, as there’s relatively little risk, often notable upside, and a much shorter path to liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p>Crucially, it also strengthens Avra’s existing machine. At the moment, much of the fund’s success depends on its goodwill with talented founders willing to teach its sessions. Without these exceptional instructors, it might struggle to attract high-quality growth-stage entrepreneurs to attend its program. Though Hariharan can relay stories and frameworks second-hand, it is more powerful for CEOs to learn directly from one another. By introducing a pre-IPO program, Avra could expressly “reward” those who teach its growth-stage program. Though these are not purely transactional relationships, having a tangible way of returning the favor and deepening the connection between Avra and this critical stakeholder fortifies its approach. “It would tie into the whole ecosystem,” Fox said. “We want to find a way to add value to our teachers as well. We do that one-off right now by introducing them to key people, but we want a systematic playbook to funnel these guests into so that they feel like they’re part of the program, too.”</p><div><hr></div><p>Running a high-growth startup is a job for which there is no real training. It might help if you’ve already built a career for yourself, but it can just as easily work against you. It’s a bonus if you can code, but certainly not a prerequisite. Have you finished your module on self-reliance? How about your symposium on irrational hubris and unhealthy tenacity? From which institution did you receive your Master’s in resourcefulness? Which PhD program granted your doctorate in pain tolerance?&nbsp;</p><p>To build a business is a lonely, bruising job; to do so while having your foot glued to the gas pedal ratchets up the stress and risk to the mix.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the closure of YC Continuity, Avra has emerged as the only serious school for the tiny subset of people building rapidly scaling businesses. Its existence is a benefit to the startup ecosystem and an illustration of the innovation still possible in venture capital. Amongst predictions of a great culling in the asset class’s ranks, Avra shows that new funds are viable, and new approaches can – with enough originality and distinctive value – become increasingly essential. The secret may be to operate as little like a venture firm as possible.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><em>The Generalist’s work is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.

You’ll fluctuate between a concern that if you price it too highly the product won’t stick, but if you price it too low, it will be impossible to build a sustainable business around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It may be tempting to look for equations and projections to find the best price. But the big secret here is that <strong>pricing isn’t a math problem: it’s a judgment problem.</strong> All businesses have prices, but most overlook pricing strategy. 85% of businesses report that they do not use thought-through pricing strategies. What’s the alternative? Guessing, I guess!</p><p>Many founders forget that - “<strong>price is your strongest signal to buyers about the quality of your offering.</strong>” It is not the other way around, where your quality offering justifies a high price.&nbsp;</p><p>That makes pricing a marketing positioning tool as well, and the long-term health of successful startups comes from understanding the critical role of pricing in your go-to-market and brand strategy.</p><h4><strong>What is product pricing and why is it important?</strong></h4><p>Product pricing is how companies decide what to charge for their goods or services. It's a big deal because it affects both <strong>how much money a business can make and how customers see the brand.</strong></p><p>When a company sets its prices, it's not just picking random numbers. </p><blockquote><p>It's actually sending a message about what kind of product it's selling.</p><p> High prices often mean "luxury" or "high-quality," while lower prices might say "affordable" or "good value."</p></blockquote><p>To figure out the right price, businesses usually think about three main things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What customers get out of it</strong> - Is the product saving them time? Solving a problem? Making them feel good?</p></li><li><p><strong>What other similar products cost</strong> - Are we pricier than our competitors? Cheaper? About the same?</p></li><li><p><strong>What the company stands for</strong> - Does the price fit with the company's image and goals?</p></li></ol><p>The tricky part is that pricing isn't just about math. It's also about how people think and feel. A $999 price tag feels very different from $1000, even though it's only a dollar less.</p><p>In the end, how you price your product tells customers what you think it's worth.</p><h4><strong>The Pricing Power Of Economic Value Analysis</strong></h4><p>When it comes to pricing, especially for unique SaaS products, looking at the <strong>economic value</strong> you're creating for customers can be super helpful. It's all about figuring out how much money you're actually saving them.</p><p><strong>Here's how it works</strong>: You add up all the ways your product helps your customer save or make money. This includes stuff like:</p><ul><li><p>Direct cost savings</p></li><li><p>Time saved by employees (think about their salaries)</p></li><li><p>Money saved on other tools or systems</p></li><li><p>Reduced risks</p></li></ul><p>Once you've got that total, you decide what's a fair chunk for you to take. Usually, this ends up being somewhere between 10% and 20% of the total value. It's weird how consistent this range is, but it seems to work for a lot of businesses.</p><p>Let's say your software helps three employees do their jobs 50% faster. If they each make about $100,000 a year, you're saving the company around $150,000 in total (half of 3 x $100,000). So you could justify charging about $30,000 a year for your product.</p><p>The cool thing about this approach is that it gives you a solid starting point for your pricing. Plus, it gives you a great story to tell your customers about why your product is worth what you're charging. Especially when you're selling to other businesses, being able to say "Look, we typically save our customers about $150,000 a year" can be really powerful.</p><p>Just remember, this is a starting point. You'll still need to think about other factors like what competitors are charging and what your target market is willing to pay. However economic value analysis can be a great tool to have in your pricing toolkit.</p><h4><strong>Other Common Pricing Strategies</strong></h4><p>Let's talk about some other ways businesses figure out their prices. While <strong>value-based pricing</strong> is great, it's not the only game in town. Different industries often mix and match pricing strategies to fit their customers and markets.</p><p><strong>One simple method is cost-plus pricing</strong>. It's pretty straightforward - you figure out how much it costs to make your product, then add a set percentage on top. Like if it costs $1 to make a cup of coffee, you might sell it for $1.20. It's easy to understand, which is why a lot of businesses use it. But it doesn't consider how customers see your product compared to others, which can be a big downside.</p><p><strong>Another common approach is competitor-based pricing</strong>. This is where you look at what similar businesses are charging and set your prices accordingly. If the coffee shop down the street sells their brew for $2, you might decide to charge $1.90 to undercut them a bit. It's important to stay in line with what people expect to pay, especially in competitive markets. But this method has its problems too. For one, if you're in a new industry, there might not be any competitors to compare yourself to. Plus, bigger companies can often produce things cheaper than startups, so trying to match their prices might mean you're losing money.</p><p><strong>Price Skimming</strong> - it's an interesting strategy some companies use when launching new products.</p><p>Basically, price skimming is when a company starts off charging a high price for their product, then gradually lowers it over time. It's like they're "skimming" the cream off the top of the market.</p><p>You see this a lot with tech gadgets. Think about when a fancy new laptop comes out - it might cost a fortune at first, maybe $3,000. But give it a year, and that same laptop could be selling for $1,000. <strong>The company is taking advantage of early adopters who are willing to pay more</strong> to have the latest and greatest.</p><p>This strategy can work really well, but it's not for everyone. It's best for products that are already getting a lot of buzz, or for well-known companies. If you're a small startup, it might be harder to pull off unless you've got something truly unique to offer.</p><p><strong>For price skimming to work, you need to tick a few boxes:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Your product needs to stand out from the crowd</p></li><li><p>You should have a clear idea of who your initial customers will be (and they should be okay with paying top dollar)</p></li><li><p>You need to be ready to lower your prices as competitors start to catch up</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg" width="1400" height="980" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:980,&quot;width&quot;:1400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Price skimming graph&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Price skimming graph" title="Price skimming graph" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd52da9b-799f-49d1-af46-428edc00f37c_1400x980.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Penetration Pricing </strong>- It's kind of the opposite of price skimming. Instead of starting high and dropping prices later, you start low to get people interested. The idea is to grab a big chunk of the market quickly by offering a great deal. Once you've got customers hooked on your product, you can slowly raise prices to where they should be.</p><p>This can be a smart move, but it's not without risks. You need deep pockets to pull it off because you'll be selling at a loss at first. It's not a good fit for every business, but in the right situation, it can help you break into a tough market.</p><p><strong>Price Tiers - </strong>This is super common in the software world. Instead of one price for everyone, you offer different packages at different price points. Maybe you have a basic version that's cheap, a mid-range option with more features, and a premium package with all the bells and whistles.</p><p>The trick here is something called <strong>price anchoring.</strong> By showing customers a range of prices, you can nudge them towards the option you really want them to pick - usually that middle-tier package. <strong>It's like the Goldilocks effect - not too expensive, not too cheap, but just right.</strong></p><p>Price tiers are great because they let customers choose what works best for them. Plus, it gives you flexibility to appeal to different types of customers, from budget-conscious folks to those who want all the extras.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg" width="1456" height="850" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:850,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:225693,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b131f2d-e213-4ccd-94e2-648f47c2fb87_2000x1167.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image Source: Better Proposals</figcaption></figure></div><p>Price tiers really shine when you've got different types of customers who need different things from your product. Your photo editing software example nails it.</p><p>Think about it:</p><ul><li><p>Students might just need basic tools and can't afford much. A low-cost, stripped-down version works for them.</p></li><li><p>Amateur photographers probably want more features but still have a budget. They'd go for a mid-range option.</p></li><li><p>Design agencies need all the bells and whistles and can afford to pay for them. They'd spring for the premium package.</p></li></ul><p>By offering these tiers, you're not just randomly splitting up features. You're tailoring your product to fit what each group needs and can afford. It's about matching value to willingness to pay.</p><p>But here's the thing - if you're not dealing with clearly different customer groups, simpler might be better. Too many options can confuse people and make it harder for them to decide. If you've got one main type of customer, a straightforward, single-price approach can be effective. It's clear, easy to understand, and sends a strong message about your product's value.</p><h4><strong>How to price your product—Price Theory In Action</strong></h4><p>Once again, there’s no hard-and-fast mathematical formula or system that will be universally effective with pricing. However, there is a best-practice methodology and approach to pricing that can be used to good effect, and will be a useful way for most founders to consider their pricing strategy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Know the customer:&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ol><p>It starts with understanding your core customer, and how your offering will create value for them. A lot of startups get hung up on their inability to collect the most detailed data at this point. However, a good estimation based on qualitative research is usually more than sufficient, in this instance, to undertake a value-based approach to pricing.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>List how you create value:&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ol><p>Once you’ve got the customer profile, the next step is to consider all of the ways that your product creates value for them. It’s a good idea to be able to quantify this with numbers to have a sense of what your product is going to be worth.</p><p>Generally speaking, there are five kinds of value to look for:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>It replaces something your customers would build for themselves.</p></li><li><p>It saves time and/or makes tasks more efficient.</p></li><li><p>It reduces risk (such as a lawsuit or inventory spoilage).</p></li><li><p>It unlocks a new source of revenue for your customer.</p></li><li><p>It has direct savings to business operations</p></li></ol><p>At this stage, if you find that your offering is not creating sufficient value for your core customer, then it may be time to go back to step 1 and search for a different or more refined target.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Take your fair share</strong></p></li></ol><p>Consider how differentiated and effective your offering is. Are you a little better? A lot better? Category-redefining better? Take your fair share of the total economic value (somewhere from 10-20 per cent) based on how differentiated you are from your core customer and how competitive your market is.</p><p>A combination of desktop research to understand the competition dynamics, and a few key customer interviews to understand their pain points and the depth of value that you’re promising to add to their experience is enough information to arrive at the right price for your product.</p><h4><strong>How to choose the right pricing strategy for your startup</strong></h4><p>A founder (who sold his startup for millions dollar) once said to me that <strong>pricing is not a math problem, but rather a judgment problem.</strong> It has stuck with me ever since because it’s very true: there are no hard-and-fast formulas that you can apply to come up with the ideal pricing for your product.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s better to remember three principles that will guide the pricing of the product. </p><ul><li><p>The first is to understand the value that your product offers to a customer. </p></li><li><p>The second is to understand that your price is always going to be your strongest signal to convey that value. </p></li><li><p>The third is to understand the impact that the competitive landscape will have on your pricing.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>This is hard to get right. Remember, 85 per cent of companies are not happy with their pricing, and that applies to enterprises with all the resources that they have access to as much as it does a startup. However, it is mission-critical to spend the effort in pricing to have true conviction behind your strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the better you understand your customers and the impact your product will have on them, the better placed you’ll be to extract maximum value and establish fierce loyalty in your brand from its earliest moments.</p><div><hr></div><h5><strong>WE CAN HELP YOU </strong></h5><h4><strong>We Write, Design And Model Your Pitch Deck Into a Storytelling Book…</strong></h4><p><strong>Pitch deck creation can feel daunting, especially for first-time founders</strong>.

Bedrock’s Investment Strategy: Search For Narrative Violations.</strong></h4><p>Rather than chase popular narratives, <strong><a href="https://bedrockcap.com/">Bedrock</a></strong>’s approach is to invest when companies are incongruent with the narrative. Simply put, search for narrative violations, which is contrarian to most investment strategies. Let’s look into how Bedrock used this strategy to find billion-dollar companies.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Narrative violations</strong> are some of the best investment chances in technology today. These companies either stand out as unique or challenge what most investors think is possible. </p></blockquote><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>SpaceX</strong>: Founders Fund invested after a rocket failure, while many thought the company was doomed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skype</strong>: Andreessen Horowitz invested when others believed Skype was failing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lyft</strong>: In 2012, people thought Uber would crush Lyft, but Lyft’s innovative approach proved strong.</p></li></ul><p>Investing in ideas that contradict popular beliefs can feel lonely for both investors and entrepreneurs.

In Silicon Valley, both outside narratives and internal beliefs can narrow the focus on what’s popular. This fixation risks missing out on groundbreaking ideas that could change industries.</p><p>By looking for entrepreneurs who challenge these narratives today, investors can back some billion-dollar companies. </p><h4><strong>2. </strong><a href="https://circle.so/">Circle’s</a> Founder, Sid Yadav’s Views on Startup Valuation</h4><p>Sid grew his startup <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle (an all-in-one community platform) </a>from 0 to $20m+ ARR in 4 years. The last financing was at a $250m valuation a year ago and has nearly doubled all metrics in the past year. He shared that a lot of people often ask him how much Circle is worth today.</p><p>After talking to some of the world’s most successful founders and digesting countless material about startup valuations, here’s what <a href="https://twitter.com/sidyadav">Sid thinks </a>about startup valuation:</p><p>“A valuation is a number an investor or acquirer comes up with based on analyzing your discounted future cashflows, while the price is a number buyers and sellers agree to act on.</p><p>Your price is not necessarily your valuation, since the former is influenced by market dynamics — demand and supply.</p><p>If you’re a private company, the valuation is what you want to pay attention to, since the only way for you to gauge the true price would be to have buyers and sellers transacting in the public market.</p><p>I like to put myself in the shoes of a potential investor or acquirer.</p><p>When they value Circle, they’ll typically look at:</p><ol><li><p>the size of our business today</p></li><li><p>the growth rate</p></li><li><p>our market size way out in the future</p></li><li><p>our ability to serve that market with valuable products</p></li><li><p>our ability to capture and sustain some of that value for ourselves</p></li><li><p>macro trends with inflation and interest rates</p></li></ol><p>It’s too late to change #1 and we don’t control #6, but #2-5 are completely in our control. No excuses.</p><p>That’s the theory. Here’s a more concrete answer:</p><p>A quick heuristic investors use to value fast-growing SaaS companies is a multiple on ARR (annual recurring revenue).</p><p>Given the day, my valuation of Circle varies between 10x to 25x our ARR.</p><p>On most days in the past 12 months, it’s been closer to 25x — because we truly have a lot going for us compared to other startups on our scale. If a major new prospect investor were to evaluate us for a transaction, I’d typically offer to send them all 50 of my monthly investor updates to back this up.</p><p>Once in a blue moon, I get as pessimistic and tell myself that Circle is likely worth a lot less than 25x our ARR.</p><p>But I also remind myself that it’s mostly in my control to act on this. It’s my fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value, so we must.</p><p>If we aren’t moving fast enough, we can fix those bottlenecks today. If we’re scaling on the wrong foundations, we can pause and reflect on our fundamentals today. If we aren’t thinking big enough about our market opportunity, we can expand our imagination today.</p><p>If a key hire isn’t working out, we can make a performance plan for them today.</p><p>Valuations are slightly subjective with some objective grounding, entirely dynamic, and always in flux. They’re a guess at what reality could be, and the subject’s lens matters more than people think.</p><p>The key is to treat them as not just a number someone else decided for you, but an intuition you act on. And remember the quote: if you don’t deal with reality, reality will deal with you.”</p><h4>3.

Despite this rich cultural diversity, navigating the immigration process remains notoriously complex, especially for those seeking permanent residency or work sponsorships. The process is often confusing and cumbersome, leading to a frustrating experience for many. While migration experts can help, their services often come with a hefty price tag and limited guidance. In Australia alone, visas are a $4 billion industry that is ripe for change. With <a href="https://www.matildamigration.com/">Matilda</a>, those who are looking for partner visas or employer sponsored visas can use the platform to simplify and automate the visa application process.&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-png-australia/">Damian Png</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-mooney-b5b34364/">Niamh Mooney</a> met through mutual friends and both have been affected by migration. Damian’s father is a migrant from Singapore and Niamh is a migrant from Ireland. Damian’s experience spans investment, consulting, and early-stage startups, while Niamh brings expertise in B2C marketing and scaling her successful tele-dermatology business. Damian, the CEO, shares more about their shared vision to simplify the complex migration process in Australia using innovative technology.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>What inspired the creation of Matilda?</strong></h4><p>My father is a migrant from Singapore, and my co-founder, Niamh, is also a migrant from Ireland. Through my work and interactions with international friends and expats, I saw the frustrations many face with the visa process. The inefficiencies and pain points made me realize that there’s a significant opportunity to improve the system with technology.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is Matilda’s North Star?</strong></h4><p>Our North Star is to transform the migration experience from a stressful and complex ordeal into an exciting new chapter in people’s lives. We are streamlining the process and making it as smooth as possible, not just for obtaining visas, but for settling into a new country.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What sets Matilda apart? </strong></h4><p>We’re very tech-driven in a space that traditionally hasn’t embraced innovation. There are over 5,000 registered migration agents in Australia and the majority operate as small family-run businesses or sole traders, Matilda leverages design and automation to offer the same services in a more efficient, affordable, user-friendly, and transparent manner. Our philosophy is that we will never ask our clients to do something that we can do on their behalf, and that ethos is pretty unique in this sector.</p><h4><strong>Tell us about some milestones that Matilda crushed.</strong></h4><p>We <a href="https://ideas.everywhere.vc/p/news-matilda-migration-raises-1m-automate-visa-process">raised $1 million in pre-seed funding</a> and hired a senior migration agent, which was a big win for us because within the existing culture it was hard to find someone who was open to innovation and excited to improve service standards in the industry. We also launched our beta phase and are serving a limited number of clients to refine our services.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Any advice for other founders? </strong></h4><p>One thing that has helped me develop my founder toolkit is being personally involved with investments, both through TechStars and personal investments. Books like <em>Zero to One</em> by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters and <em>Angel</em> by Jason Calacanis help you get into the mindset of an investor. It’s less about trying to please investors and more about understanding that investors have spent a lot of time thinking about what the blueprint for a successful company looks like. Being able to put that hat on and critically look at your business really helps you with prioritization.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>Listen to  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gadalia-o-bryan/">Gadalia Montoya Weinberg O'Bryan</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arinewman/">Ari Newman</a> on the Venture Everywhere podcast: <a href="https://ideas.everywhere.vc/p/podcast-gadalia-montoya-weinberg-obryan-ari-newman-episode47">Access Granted</a>.

The problem with many studies, however, is that they only cover partial aspects, rarely painting the full picture. Therefore, the ambition with today’s episode is to bring it all together and create a comprehensive guide to founder compensation.</p><h2>Why is Founder Compensation so Complicated?</h2><p>Navigating the delicate balance between fair compensation and prudent business practices is no easy feat, especially under the scrutiny of investors. Conflicting expectations about what constitutes a reasonable salary can create significant tension—investors often prioritize runway preservation, while founders need sufficient income to sustain a viable lifestyle.</p><p>It's essential to remember that while lean times are part of the early startup journey, the idea of founders scraping by indefinitely is unrealistic. Founders must secure enough income to alleviate financial stress and maintain focus on building their businesses.</p><p>These challenges are made even more complicated when considering that founders often come from different backgrounds: One might be 25, single, and living in a smaller Spanish city, while another is 45, raising kids in New York City. These different living situations lead to dramatically varying financial needs, and striking the right balance is difficult.</p><p>Transparency around compensation creates trust among employees, investors, and stakeholders. The decisions founders make about their own pay can set the tone for company culture—transparent and thoughtful compensation signals fairness and alignment with growth, which can help attract and retain talent.</p><p>In this episode, we’ll look at best practices from scientific literature, and provide a snapshot of the current landscape, using real-world data to help you make informed compensation decisions. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png" width="1456" height="759" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:759,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:459572,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e46d74c-d587-4eb7-b0eb-82ff8bdad2b3_1676x874.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><h2>Compensation and Equity</h2><p>One of the fundamental trends in startup compensation is the inverse relationship between equity stakes and cash compensation. As founders hold larger equity shares, their cash salaries tend to decrease (Wasserman, <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2006.22798177">2006</a>). This dynamic is rooted in the concept of psychological ownership—equity provides founders with a direct, personal stake in the success of the business, fostering a focus on long-term value rather than short-term gains.</p><p>Equity ownership also aligns founders' interests with those of other shareholders, emphasizing growth and later profitability. Unlike cash compensation, which tends to encourage more conservative decision-making, founders with significant equity are often willing to pursue riskier, innovative strategies, betting on the company’s future success (Alkebsee et al., <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JAEE-12-2020-0336/full/html">2021</a>; Atif et al., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X17303219?via%3Dihub">2020</a>; Bruton et al., <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00309.x">2009</a>). The long-term incentives provided by equity mean that founders are more likely to prioritize visionary moves over short-term financial stability, thereby enhancing the company's potential for substantial growth.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href="https://www.newsletter.datadrivenvc.io/p/founder-compensation-and-equity-benchmarks">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   </body></html>	The importance of transparency and the balance between fair compensation and prudent business practices.

It’s a dance between flexibility and caution. In India, flexible office spaces are on the rise, while Singapore’s prime office market is treading water. Both regions reflect broader trends in the global economy.<br>In India, flexible office space operators have attracted a staggering $820 million in private equity funding since 2017. This surge is fueled by a growing demand from corporates seeking innovative workspaces. The market is vibrant, yet it has faced its share of turbulence. The pandemic hit hard, causing investments to plummet. In 2020, funding dropped to a mere $11 million. The recovery was swift in 2022, with investments soaring to $595 million. However, the momentum faltered again, with only $13 million in funding reported by 2023.</p><h3>2. <a href="https://parsers.vc/news/241001-the-voice-revolution--how-wispr-flow-is/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-october-8-2024&amp;_bhlid=56cb2f5f90f8fa0b99b7b840314ac0b0dbd0d2dc">The Voice Revolution: How Wispr Flow is Redefining Productivity</a>&nbsp;</h3><p><em>(Cited in 13 tech media)</em></p><p>In a world where speed is king, typing feels like a relic.

Google is the latest player to embrace this trend. Recent findings reveal that Google is testing a new user interface (UI) for its Phone app, which could soon resemble the familiar layout of the iPhone. This shift reflects a broader movement towards a more standardized user experience across devices.<br>The Android Authority uncovered evidence of this change in the APK of Google Phone version 145.0.672690850. Currently, when a call comes in, users swipe up to answer or swipe down to reject. This gesture-based system is unique to Google’s Pixel line. However, the new interface will replace these swipes with two distinct buttons: one for answering and one for rejecting calls. This design is reminiscent of the iPhone and aligns more closely with the layouts seen on Samsung devices.</p><h3>5. <a href="https://parsers.vc/news/241001-the-digital-tightrope--navigating-corporate/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-october-8-2024&amp;_bhlid=c43230fe0ad98dce5b2353e63caf9730ecfa3e2d">The Digital Tightrope: Navigating Corporate Communication Risks with Telegram</a>&nbsp;</h3><p><em>(Cited in 10 tech media)</em></p><p>In the corporate world, communication is the lifeblood of productivity.

It promises a future where cars drive themselves, freeing us from the mundane task of steering. But recent studies reveal a darker side. The system exhibits "dangerous behavior," requiring human intervention every 21 kilometers. This is not just a minor hiccup; it’s a glaring red flag.<br>Researchers from AMCI Testing conducted a thorough evaluation of FSD versions 12.5.1 and 12.5.3. They tested the system in various environments: bustling city streets, quiet rural roads, winding mountain paths, and busy highways. The results were mixed. On one hand, FSD showcased impressive maneuvers. It could deftly slide into gaps between parked cars to let oncoming traffic pass. It even adjusted its path to create space for pedestrians waiting at crosswalks. Such capabilities highlight the system's potential.</p><h3>8. <a href="https://parsers.vc/news/241002-the-rise-of-ai-in-automotive--numa-and/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-october-8-2024&amp;_bhlid=7054e76f2be5670ed4642f438a05e4c9f99cd21f">The Rise of AI in Automotive: Numa and Broom Lead the Charge </a></h3><p><em>(Cited in 9 tech media)</em></p><p>The automotive industry is undergoing a seismic shift.

The percentage rises as companies scale, from 35% for those raising up to $5M, to 73% for those raising $500M+.</p></li><li><p><strong>How much:</strong> Grant sizes are relatively consistent across company stages. Typically, CEOs receive between 0.7% (25th percentile) and 5.9% (75th percentile) of total ownership in refresh grants, with a median of 2%.</p></li><li><p><strong>When:</strong> Timing varies, 33% of Founder CEOs receive a refresh within six months of finishing their initial vesting, while 29% wait over two years.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg" width="710" height="458.86675824175825" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:710,&quot;bytes&quot;:180567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f963f96-a7af-4086-8cbb-cc88ccd5e985_2048x1324.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><h4><em><strong>✈️ KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></em></h4><p><em>Refresh equity grants for Founder CEOs are common, especially as companies grow and raise more funds.

But what’s rarely discussed is “F<strong>undraising is a learned skill</strong>.” And VCs almost always have the upper hand because they deal with it all day, every day.</p><p>In reality, knowing what to expect from VCs – the negotiation dynamics Founders are likely to encounter – is half the battle.</p><p>Before you start talking with VCs, take the time to learn how to detect and manage these little-known fundraising dynamics. Let’s dig in. ( We are sharing this in a more conversational format….)</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Portfolio Trap</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> "I'd like you to meet with one of our portfolio companies in your space. They can provide valuable insights, and we'd appreciate their perspective on your venture."</p><p>This request often puts founders in a tricky position. Sharing your plans with a potential competitor can be risky, and the existing portfolio company has little incentive to endorse your startup. They may tell the VC they're planning to expand into your area, making it challenging for the investor to back you. While VCs might have good intentions, this practice can sometimes backfire or be used to gather intelligence for their existing investments.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> If the suggested company is too close to your business, politely decline:</p><p>"I appreciate the offer and value your network. However, given the significant overlap between our business and this portfolio company, I'm not comfortable sharing our strategic plans. Perhaps we could meet with other industry experts who aren't directly in our space?"</p><p>If the portfolio company isn't a direct competitor, consider accepting:</p><p>"Thank you for the introduction. I'd be happy to meet with them. It would be valuable to hear about their experience working with your firm and get their industry insights."</p><p>Remember, your goal is to protect your business interests while maintaining a positive relationship with the potential investor. If you do meet, use it as an opportunity to learn about the VC's support and working style from an existing portfolio founder's perspective.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>The Valuation Conversation</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> "What valuation are you looking for in this round?" or "What's your target price for the company?"</p><p>This question is a common tactic used by VCs to gauge your expectations and potentially anchor negotiations at a lower point. While it's a legitimate inquiry, it can be a pitfall for founders who, in an attempt to appear reasonable, might suggest a valuation below their company's true worth. Remember, any figure you mention could become the ceiling, not the floor, for further discussion.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> Unless you're dealing with a priced extension round or a convertible note with predetermined terms, it's wise to defer to market dynamics. A tactful response might be:</p><p>"We're open to letting the market determine our valuation. We're more focused on finding the right partners who can add value beyond just capital."</p><p>If you've had a previous funding round, you can provide context without committing to a specific number:</p><p>"Our last round valued the company at $X million post-money. Since then, we've achieved significant milestones, including [brief mention of key metrics or achievements]. We believe these developments have substantially increased our value, but we're eager to hear the market's perspective."</p><p>This approach demonstrates confidence in your company's progress while leaving room for negotiation and avoiding the trap of undervaluing your startup prematurely.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Turn Into Home Run</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> "Based on our analysis, we'd like to offer you $X million at a valuation of $Y million."</p><p>This initial offer might seem disappointingly low. It's a common strategy in VC negotiations, often serving as a starting point rather than a final stance. Inexperienced founders sometimes react emotionally, potentially derailing a deal that could have been salvaged with the right approach.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> The key is to remain composed and professional. A strategic response might look like this:</p><p>"Thank you for your offer. We appreciate your interest in our company. While this valuation is considerably below our expectations, we'd like to take some time to review it in detail. We'll get back to you soon with our thoughts."</p><p>This response acknowledges the offer without accepting or rejecting it outright. It buys you time to explore other options and potentially leverage them.</p><p>If you receive more attractive offers later, you can circle back:</p><p>"We've had some time to consider your offer and explore the market. We've received interest at significantly higher valuations that better align with our growth trajectory and potential. We value our relationship and wanted to allow you to revisit your offer if you're interested. If not, we completely understand and hope to stay in touch for future opportunities."</p><p>This approach keeps the door open while signalling that you have other options. It gives the VC a chance to improve its offer without burning bridges. Remember, maintaining positive relationships in the VC world can be beneficial for future funding rounds or networking opportunities.</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Deflect the Friendly Lowball</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> After a warm, engaging meeting filled with enthusiasm and positive feedback, the VC follows up with a surprisingly low offer. This unexpected contrast between their friendly demeanour and the underwhelming valuation can catch founders off guard.</p><p>This scenario often leads founders to doubt their judgment or feel pressured to accept a subpar offer due to the perceived rapport. It's a subtle tactic that leverages the positive connection established during the meeting.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> The key is to maintain your composure and separate your emotions from the business decision at hand. A balanced response might look like this:</p><p>"Thank you for the offer. We truly enjoyed our meeting and appreciate your enthusiasm for our vision. However, the proposed valuation is significantly lower than what we believe reflects our company's current value and potential. We'd like to take some time to carefully consider this offer in the context of our market research and growth projections. We'll get back to you soon with our thoughts on how we might bridge this gap."</p><p>If the VC doesn't adjust their offer, you can follow up with:</p><p>"We've given your offer careful consideration. While we greatly value the potential of working together, we feel that this valuation doesn't align with our company's trajectory and the current market. We're open to further discussion if there's room for adjustment. If not, we hope to keep the door open for future opportunities as our company grows."</p><p>This approach maintains a positive relationship while firmly asserting your company's value. It leaves room for negotiation without committing to an undervalued deal. Remember, a good partnership should be mutually beneficial, balancing enthusiasm with fair terms.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Focus on Pre-Money Valuation</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> "We're looking at investing $2M at an $8M post-money valuation."</p><p>VCs often frame discussions in post-money terms, which can lead to confusion and potentially reduced founder ownership if the round size changes.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> "Thank you for the offer. To ensure we're on the same page, let's discuss this in terms of pre-money valuation. Based on your proposal, we're looking at a $6M pre-money valuation. Is that correct? We prefer to focus on pre-money valuation as our fundraising target may adjust."</p><ol start="6"><li><p><strong>ESOP Negotiations</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> "We'd like to see a 20% ESOP allocation before the round."</p><p>VCs often push for large ESOP pools to reduce their future dilution. They may request excessive allocations, sometimes up to 20% or more, which can significantly impact founder ownership.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> "We've analyzed our hiring needs until the next funding round. Based on our projections, a 10% post-round ESOP pool should suffice. This includes 2% for a key hire we've identified and 5% for additional team members over the next 18 months. This aligns with market standards for seed rounds and ensures we have enough to attract top talent without over-diluting existing shareholders. We're open to discussing specific concerns you may have about our hiring plan."</p><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Distinguish Genuine Interest</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>VC:</strong> "We're interested in investing, but we'd need you to find a lead investor first," or "We'd like to commit, contingent on you raising the rest of the round."</p><p>VCs often use these tactics to keep their options open without fully committing. They're expressing interest but aren't ready to take the lead or make a firm commitment.</p><p><strong>Founder’s Reply:</strong> "We appreciate your interest in our company. We're currently focusing on investors who are ready to commit without contingencies. Once we secure our lead investor, we'll reach out if there's still room in the round. In the meantime, would you be open to introducing us to any potential lead investors in your network?"</p><p>This response politely acknowledges their interest while prioritizing more committed investors.

Any plan you had when you started gets changed quickly. Every day or even hour of your time that you devote to your startup needs to be spent getting it off the ground. The same is true for a financial model. Your projections will be wildly wrong.<br><br>Not only that, but the levers you have at your disposal in the model may not end up being what you think they’ll be — the entire business may change, and you likely don’t know enough yet at the pre-seed stage to be sure.<br><br>Investors all know this. They see tons of startups and have many first-hand data points showing that everything can change and often does.<br><br>What they don’t know is if YOU know that.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Investors are looking to de-risk the idea of investing in you.</strong> Startups are inherently so risky that they look for ways to think of your startup as less risky than others. <strong>One of those ways is to assess your founder mindset</strong> — how much do you “get” what being a founder will really be like?</p></blockquote><p>The thinking there is that the more you “get” it the more you’ll be able to anticipate challenges and be emotionally steady when things get rocky.<br><br>This is a very common place where first-time founders and founders who don’t have a strong network fail to build trust with an investor. That might not be fair, but it’s true. Two of those signals for how well someone is ready to be a venture-backed founder are:<br><br><strong>How well do they know how to prioritize their time?</strong> - Whether they realize everything will change from their “plan” or not. Presenting investors with detailed financial projections at the pre-seed stage fails both of those tests.</p><p>Get free access to the financial model <strong><a href="https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/financialmodeltemplate">template</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Ok… So Why is a Financial Model Useful?</strong></p><p>VCs who want to see a model use it as a proxy for understanding whether a founder can correctly break down the incentives and value levers in a problem space.<br><br>VCs want to trust that if the business needs to change, the founder will be able to quickly figure out how to evaluate new opportunities and position their product for success in a new market. It's just a different way of de-risking an investment opportunity.<br><br>The simple takeaway is that each investor is different in what traits they value and how they reach conviction. So Know your investor - talk to their backed founders, and read their content. Think about the type of investor you want as a partner based on their evaluation approach.</p><h4><strong>2. Steve Jobs on Ideas and Products</strong></h4><p>The hardest part about being a founder isn’t finding a good opportunity, it’s everything that comes after.</p><p>You learn little things every day that you need to remember and piece together into a product. It’s impossible to get it exactly right ahead of time — you need to listen and learn.</p><p>This is why being a founder is such an intense “job.”</p><p>You need to constantly make the tradeoff between moving as fast as possible and implementing true craftsmanship into your product. You can’t assume either will happen — you need to be in the details with your team and your users on every bit of it.</p><p>Steve Jobs talked about the importance of craftsmanship, which clearly came through in Apple’s products during his lifetime:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg" width="1292" height="729" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:729,&quot;width&quot;:1292,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f173f-b4f7-4d2a-9471-05e43ce65457_1292x729.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h4>3.

Post</a></p><p>This is something that a site like <a href="http://acquire.com">acquire.com</a> could build or, ironically, you could sell it to them.</p><h3>🧠<strong> Framework: Smallest Enterprise Strategy</strong></h3><p><a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part5.html">Marc Andreessen said</a> that startups shouldn’t sell to enterprise customers because deals take too long, require too much time and functionality built right away, and can go south for reasons outside the startup’s control.</p><p>So how can b2b startups who know they’ll be able to anticipate the needs of enterprise customers, or even know they’ll be able to service them in the future at all?</p><p><a href="https://x.com/anshublog/status/1843741351390916657">The Smallest Enterprise strategy says</a> founders should identify the smallest companies with comparable problems, processes, and tools that larger (true enterprise) customers have.</p><p>This can help founders frame the opportunity in front of them — if your smallest enterprise is still quite large, the opportunity is that much riskier to pursue.</p><h3><strong>🛠 Tool: <a href="https://www.remofirst.com/">Remofirst</a></strong></h3><p>Founders these days can employ the best talent around the world when scaling their teams, with the help of an Employer of Record provider.</p><p><a href="https://www.remofirst.com/">Remofirst</a> is an Employer of Record that allows businesses to employ talent in 180+ countries the most affordable way, without needing local entities.</p><p>They take on the responsibility of global payroll, international HR, compliance with local laws, and more, bringing the best talent in the world to your fingertips.</p><p>As a Founding Journey reader, you’ll <a href="https://www.remofirst.com/">get 2 months free</a> on your first global hire, in any country.*</p><h3>📈<strong> Trend: AI’s Impact on Software</strong></h3><p>I’ve written a lot about how AI is already disrupting SaaS, to the point where questioning the role of SaaS in the startup ecosystem is not as crazy as it would have sounded a few years ago.</p><p>But that’s not the only opportunity that’s emerged:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank"

like Tanay’s framing of the two viewpoints but disagree that they’re divergent — it’s likely some version of both will occur.</p><p>In the past, customers wanted software to make them more efficient — now they don’t really care about incremental efficiency gains and, instead, just want to pay for the work itself to be done.</p><p>Whether that work is done by an AI agent or personal, on-demand software is irrelevant to the end user. As a result, the right solution will depend on the problem.</p><p>The struggle will be between startups that try to tackle either end of a market with one of these two approaches, and the incumbents who have an inherent advantage in terms of training data to build them themselves.</p><p>Startups will need to move fast in order to actually cause disruption.</p><h3>💬<strong> Quote: The Personal Touch</strong></h3><p>A change happened in San Francisco around 2017-2018.</p><p>I was living there at the time and remember that, all of a sudden, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brex-corporate-card-for-startups-covers-san-francisco-with-billboards-2018-8">billboards around the city started popping up for this startup called Brex</a>.</p><p>I didn’t really know what they did (I was working at Airbnb at the time and had no need for a startup credit card) but I distinctly knew them as <em>that company with the billboards</em>.</p><p>This wasn’t uncommon, and the billboards are legitimately a big part of their early story that many startups have tried to copy ever since. Go around SF now and <em>every</em> billboard is for a startup or big tech company.</p><p>Anyway, it turns out Brex was just as thoughtful with sales as they were with marketing:</p><div

While wind and solar power are the most affordable renewable energy options, their intermittent nature creates challenges. Energy storage plays a key role in addressing this intermittency with the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimating that to meet net zero targets <em>non-hydropower</em> energy storage will have to increase from <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-installed-energy-storage-capacity-by-scenario-2023-and-2030">87GW in 2023 to about 1200 GW in 2030</a>. This rapid increase in energy storage is essential to manage the variability of wind and solar power. It allows excess energy produced during periods of high generation (like daytime for solar) to be stored and used during times of low generation (such as nighttime when solar isn't producing). This ability to shift energy from when it's generated to when it's needed is key to supporting the transition to renewable energy sources.</p><p>Our current reliance on lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries to meet energy storage needs presents 3 major limitations.</p><h3><strong>Potential supply shortages.</strong> </h3><p>One of the main risks is that the demand for lithium and other critical materials used in Li-ion batteries is exceeding supply and is expected to last through the next decade. According to McKinsey, the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/battery%202030%20resilient%20sustainable%20and%20circular/svg-battery-2030-ex01-v4.svgz?cq=50&amp;cpy=Center">global demand for Li-ion cells</a> will grow 6X from 2022 (~700 GWh) to 2030 (~4700 GWh). Albemarle the world's largest lithium producer is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/lithium-producers-warn-global-supplies-may-not-meet-electric-vehicle-demand-2023-06-22/#:~:text=Still%2C%20it%20expects%20global%20lithium,warn%20of%20a%20looming%20shortage">forecasting a shortage</a> by 2030 as are other industry players and analysts. The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/doe-critical-material-assessment_07312023.pdf">critical minerals assessment</a> has rated the supply risk of lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and copper, all used in Li-ion batteries as critical between 2025-2035 (see Figure 1). This supply shortage will negatively impact stationary energy storage as the needs of EVs will take precedence given the market power and market size of the automotive industry and the value premium of mobility over stationary energy storage. The lack of adequate build-out of stationary energy storage will lead to curtailing of wind and solar and continuing use of fossil fuel power plants to meet the nighttime energy demand.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png" width="554" height="548" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:548,&quot;width&quot;:554,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff85268ff-6047-4ebf-a218-b4038820960b_554x548.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(Figure 1)</figcaption></figure></div><h3><strong>Supply chain security concerns</strong>. </h3><p>Beyond demand outstripping supply, the security of Li-ion supply chains also presents significant risks.

The LCOE of utility solar in the first half of 2023 was ~$45/MWh, onshore wind was $42/MWh and Lithium-ion based batteries was $155/MWh <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/cost-of-clean-energy-technologies-drop-as-expensive-debt-offset-by-cooling-commodity-prices/">as reported by BNEF</a>. Li- ion batteries, though 3 times as expensive as solar or wind, are cost-effective for short durations of a few hours primarily due to two <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/blog-posts/why-long-duration-energy-storage-matters">value streams</a> unique to shorter durations below ~8 hours of storage.</p><p>The first is grid services to maintain demand-supply matching for very short time horizons ranging from a few seconds to about an hour. The second is energy arbitrage in which the energy storage system charges (buying electricity) at the low-price hours of the day and discharges (selling electricity) at the higher price hours.&nbsp; This energy arbitrage is not available for longer durations and the cost of Li-ion is too expensive to be profitable beyond 8 hrs (see Figure 3).&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png" width="618" height="504" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:504,&quot;width&quot;:618,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d4242c4-b879-48e8-aa03-a2469b0c4223_618x504.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(Figure 3)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Increasing electrification of energy needs and deployment of intermittent solar and wind power will increase the need for longer duration storage. <a href="https://www.ldescouncil.com/assets/pdf/LDES-brochure-F3-HighRes.pdf">Analysis </a>by the Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) Council indicates that newer technologies being developed for longer durations would be more cost-effective than Li-ion for durations beyond 6-8 hrs. </p><blockquote><p><em>It is a $4 trillion marketplace for LDES.

This initiative aims to develop technologies that can store energy for 10 hours or more at a cost of $50/MWh or less by 2030. By exploring alternative chemistries, mechanical or thermal-based solutions, or combinations thereof, we can create a more secure and sustainable future for energy storage.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the solutions in various stages of development are Sodium-ion, Nickel-hydrogen and Zinc-ion based electro-chemistries, redox flow batteries, compressed air energy storage (CAES), gravity-based storage as well as hydrogen-based energy storage.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Energy storage is a key enabler of the decarbonization of the energy sector which is critical to our net zero efforts. The need for developing innovative, cost-effective energy storage solutions based on secure supply chains presents a tremendous opportunity to entrepreneurs, investors, governments and the broader climate tech community.

There has always been better and worse science — that goes with the territory — but as I argued last week, we are now in <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review">an era of tactical research</a>, with science curated to advance narratives over knowledge. That makes knowing what’s what even more difficult.</p><p>I spend a lot of time here at THB on the chaff, and by reader request, I am going to try to spend more time also on the wheat. To that end, this week has already seen cross my desk an unusually large number of really interesting recent peer-reviewed papers that I’m sharing with you today. Let’s get to it . . .</p><ul><li><p><strong>A recent surge in global warming is not detectable yet</strong> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01711-1">Beaulieu et al. 2024</a>, open access). Top line results: </p><blockquote><p>“Our results show limited evidence for a warming surge; in most surface temperature time series, no change in the warming rate beyond the 1970s is detected despite the breaking record temperatures observed in 2023.”</p></blockquote><p>The paper employs the traditional IPCC framework for detection and attribution and assess what levels of global temperature increases would have to occur to achieve detection. The authors find that the recent “surge” is not very close to that magnitude of increase:</p><blockquote><p>“Accounting for the short-term variability in the HadCRUT GMST over 1970–2023 and the added uncertainty for the changepoint location, the second segment (2013–2023) would need a slope of at least 0.039∘C/year (more than a 100% increase) to be statistically different than 0.019 at the α = 0.05 significance level right now. The estimated slope of 0.029 ∘C/year falls far short of this needed increase. While it is still possible there was a change in the warming rate starting in 2013, the HadCRUT record is simply not long enough for the surge to be statistically detectable at this time.”</p></blockquote><p>This paper is sure to motivate much debate as it is contrary to gobsmacking claims made by some visible scientists. Debate is good for science and for science in the public eye.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-warming-surge-climate-model-biases?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-warming-surge-climate-model-biases?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></li><li><p><strong>Crucial role of sea surface temperature warming patterns in near-term high-impact weather and climate projection</strong> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00681-7">Zhao and Knutson 2024</a>, open access). <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/research_highlight/crucial-role-of-sea-surface-temperature-warming-patterns-in-near-term-high-impact-weather-and-climate-projection/">Top line results</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>“Model biases in SST [sea surface temperature] trend patterns are shown to have profound implications for near-term projections of high-impact storm statistics, including the frequency of atmospheric rivers, tropical storms and mesoscale convection systems, as well as for hydrological and climate sensitivity. If the future SST warming pattern continues to resemble the observed pattern from the past few decades rather than the model-simulated/predicted patterns, these results suggest:</p><ul><li><p>A drastically different future projection of high-impact storms and their associated hydroclimate changes, especially over the Western Hemisphere.</p></li><li><p>Stronger global hydrological sensitivity.</p></li><li><p>Substantially less global warming due to stronger negative feedback and lower climate sensitivity.”</p></li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>This paper identifies systematic biases in how climate models represent ocean temperatures and explores the implications of these biases for projections of the climate future. The paper concludes:</p><blockquote><p>“Our results indicate that if the future SST trend pattern continues to resemble the observed pattern from the past few decades rather than that simulated or predicted by climate models, we would anticipate a drastically different picture of future changes of high-impact storm statistics . . .”</p></blockquote><p>This paper as well will likely motivate some interesting discussions and future work. The most important implication for consumers of climate research is to recognize that our near-term climate future likely encompasses a much wider range of possibilities than we (collectively) generally expect or hear discussed.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-warming-surge-climate-model-biases?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-warming-surge-climate-model-biases?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></li><li><p><strong>Robust future projections of global spatial distribution of major tropical cyclones and sea level pressure gradients</strong> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01644-9">Murakami et al. 2024</a>, open access).</p><p></p><p>I found this paper particularly interesting because it was published just a few weeks before Hurricanes Helene and Milton made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing hundreds and resulting in tens of billions of dollars in economic losses.

The gains made by female runners using so-called “super-shoe” technology are much greater than gains made by elite men. The paper argues that understanding this issue lacks evidence because most studies are of men, and neglect women. The authors explore,</p><blockquote><p>“why women may be benefiting from the new generation of shoes more than men, suggest potential mechanisms leading to hypotheses that need to be further investigated in upcoming studies, and finally propose that factors outside of footwear innovation may have concurrently driven the recently observed performance evolutions.”</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-warming-surge-climate-model-biases/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-warming-surge-climate-model-biases/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>I welcome your comments and discussion.

Though every bill possesses the same lineny texture, coveted color, and sensitive etching, each is bestowed with a distinctive gravity originating from its giver. Which is to say that receiving a $10 million investment from Founders Fund differs from receiving the same sum from an unheralded firm.&nbsp;</p><p>That entrepreneurs and the wider ecosystem feel this shimmering variance is a testament to soft power’s role in matching talent and capital. Even the industry’s best-resourced shops rely on voice, reach, reputation, influence, and storytelling to attract opportunities and outmaneuver rivals. In many cases, it is a fund’s principal weapon. If you were to strip Andreessen Horowitz of its platform team or Sequoia Capital of its senior talent, each would find a way to win, such is the strength of their soft power.</p><p>Soft power’s potency is matched only by the torpor with which it develops. It may take decades to burnish a reputation into a high sheen or chisel out a zone of influence, but it doesn’t have to. By developing a distinctive voice, leveraging the distributive reach of the Internet, and publishing differentiated work, even VCs in their first acts have been able to contrive a special magnetism, to draw boundaries around the beginnings of a personal monopoly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To understand how different managers construct soft power, we interviewed 17 notable investors. Some have been running firms and writing in public for over 20 years. Others are newer capital allocators but have already succeeded in standing out from the crowd, leveraging modern mediums and strategies. By learning about their approaches – including the trade-offs made and lessons learned – you’ll be ready to accelerate your soft power campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>Although today’s guide is geared toward investors, its lessons are applicable to anyone interested in developing unique personal magnetism at scale.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png" width="1080" height="1080" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:472147,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F585fee07-25ac-407b-a84b-fe4c9b923b88_1080x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>What to expect</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Master how to build and leverage soft power</strong>.

Rules of thumb</h2><p>Before learning how to generate soft power, understanding why it’s valuable in a venture context is worthwhile. For much of the asset class’s history, having a strong public presence wasn’t necessary, given the relative lack of competition. When Ann Miura-Ko and Mike Maples formed Floodgate, for example, little marketing was required:</p><h4><strong>Floodgate</strong></h4><blockquote><p>In 2008, you didn’t even have to have a sign on your door. That has evolved.</p><p><em>– Ann Miura-Ko</em></p></blockquote><p>As the asset class has grown, inviting greater and fiercer competition, the need to differentiate has increased, too. Critically, firms must do more than distinguish themselves – they must <em>message</em> those distinctions memorably, at scale. It is no good to hold a unique perspective or run an unusual model if entrepreneurs don’t know about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank Rotman of QED and Logan Bartlett of Redpoint articulated the importance of differentiation in today’s venture market.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>QED</strong></h4><blockquote><p>It was much easier when fintech was a very niche thing. When we started investing <strong>in 2008, only $1 billion was invested in fintech globally. At its peak, it hit $140 billion. </strong>Those two ecosystems are not the same, right? Being a big fish in a little pond is not that hard. When a founder was looking to raise, they just had to ask, “Who is active?” That, plus a few very public winners like SoFi and Credit Karma, helped us a lot initially.&nbsp;</p><p>One day, it occurred to me that <strong>we weren’t the only game in town anymore</strong>. It was going to be a lot easier for everyone to know who we were rather than us knowing who everyone was. Just being active was no longer enough. <strong>My strategy was: You have to have a voice.</strong></p><p><em>– Frank Rotman</em></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Redpoint</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Differentiating is really, really hard</strong>. Once upon a time, you had to show up in a room with a founder and differentiate there. It allowed for more personality and the ability to earn trust over time rather than in a shorter, more finite, transactional period.&nbsp;</p><p>During COVID, I realized that space was no longer a bottleneck. Anyone could be on a Zoom screen. I was competing with people like Marc Andreessen, who started the web browser; or Roelof Botha and Doug Leone, who were parachuting into deals; or someone like Keith Rabois. And <strong>I didn’t know what to do, honestly.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I started to think about finding a potentially additive way of getting myself out there. <strong>I knew I needed to stand out somehow</strong>, but I didn’t know what form it would take. It ultimately required a few cycles to figure it out.&nbsp;</p><p><em>– Logan Bartlett</em></p></blockquote><p>Creating that differentiation does not come easily. Many find it daunting to start “thinking in public,” either through writing, podcasts, or another medium. A few rules of thumb can help overcome initial nerves, find your unique voice, avoid blandness, and initiate the alchemical process. I wish I had known these before starting <em>The Generalist</em>, and as it happens, much of the advice VCs gave echoed it.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Lower your shipping threshold to start.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>No tribute acts.</p></li><li><p>Nothing too dear to kill.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fight the beige.</p></li><li><p>Small is mighty.</p></li><li><p>This is slow magic.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h3>Lower your shipping threshold to start</h3><p>There will always be a good reason <em>not </em>to write an article or record a podcast. It takes time, focus, possibly social or financial capital, and a degree of vulnerability. What if you say something stupid? What if an investor you admire disagrees with your fundamental premise? In the short term, there seems to be much more to lose than gain.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that, lowering your shipping threshold in the early days can be helpful. If you try to create something utterly perfect out of the gate – especially if creating is new to you – you’ll likely stall out. A folder full of half-completed, unpublished blog posts is a sign that you’re stuck in this pattern. When you notice you’re falling into this kind of a cycle, narrow the scope of your project, lower your threshold for publishing, and get something out the door.

The less they can pay their employees without them leaving, the more money they make.</p><p>This isn’t an evil conspiracy. It’s just how the job market works. Once you see this truth you can’t unsee it.</p><p>Now making money on the internet has become popular in the last few years and created real competition for employers.</p><p>Still, it hasn’t clicked for most people. Let me explain so you can take advantage of this trend (and still keep your job if you choose).</p><h1><strong>You’re an accidental entrepreneur and don’t even realize it (let me show you)</strong></h1><p>An employer doesn’t pay you for your sexy smile or well-toned ass.</p><p>No. They pay you for a skill stack. Those skills have value. And that value isn’t unique to your employer. Other people or organizations need those same skills.</p><p>Think of yourself as a business called You INC. Think of your employer as a customer. If you have a traditional full-time job you have one customer.</p><p>I have a friend who owns an IT consulting firm. He told me he has one big government customer. They make him stacks of cash.</p><p>I jokingly said “what if they terminate you?”</p><p>His mind seemed to glitch. It’s obvious that a business with one customer is a stupid idea. So why should our You INC LLC be any different?</p><p>Hint: it shouldn’t be.</p><p>Every business including the business of You needs more than one customer to diversify and survive.</p><h1><strong>The mental block of “sell once”</strong></h1><p>So if it’s obvious we need to sell our skills more than once, why do we fall for this trap? Simple.</p><p>Employees (and I was one for decades) are scared of non-compete agreements. These are those hidden paragraphs in an employment contract that are designed to scare you.</p><p>They say things like “you can’t work for anyone else” and “you better not steal our company secrets, pal.”</p><p>These clauses aren’t serious. Non-compete clauses are hard to enforce.</p><p>I once worked for a company in banking. Their employment contract said that once I work for their banking customer, I couldn’t work for another global bank for 3 years.</p><p>Lol.</p><p>Okay, so if this company fired me, I couldn’t get another job for 3 years because they said so? So I’ll just starve and feed my body parts to my daughter for dinner because a corporation said so?</p><p>It’s crazy when you break it down.</p><p>These clauses are there to make you fearful. No judge in a court is going to say “sorry Timbo, you’re not able to work a job for 3 years. You’ll just have to wait it out. The law is the law.”</p><p>Now you know why people won’t have more than one employer (customer). They accidentally think it’s illegal.</p><p>I got fooled for years until my lawyer told me the truth.</p><h1><strong>The hidden path to sell skills online</strong></h1><p>Many people know they can make money on the internet.</p><p>I run an entire academy on the topic, and the biggest objection I get is “what do I sell?” This is where I get confused.</p><p>The thing you sell online is the same thing you already do for work. It’s the easiest option.</p><p>Instead, I meet nice people who lose their life savings because they think what they sell online has to be different to their current career.</p><p>So they throw themselves into the deep end of a new product or industry they know nothing about and lose the shirt off their back and go broke.</p><p>Sell the thing online that you sell to your employer. Or sell the same or similar product/service as your employer.</p><h1><strong>Internet customers pay more for this bizarre reason</strong></h1><p>I spent my career in finance here in Australia.</p><p>I got paid okay but compared to my American friends I earned peanuts. That’s because Australia isn’t as wealthy as America. Our economy is built on top of tourism, college education, and selling coal.</p><p>We’re a three-trick pony that could easily be blown over by one of our overseas cousins who blows a mouthful of air on us.</p><p>When I started selling my 9-5 skills online the pay went up. That’s because the people in America who paid me were wealthier. To the finance geeks in the room this is called arbitrage.</p><p>It exists in many countries. The value of your skills in each country has a different price tag.</p><p>You can shop various countries to see which ones pay the most for your skills. Then you can live in that country virtually and get paid for your work through the teleportation device known as the internet.</p><p>This is where people in 3rd world countries — who we often feel sorry for — have a huge advantage.</p><h1><strong>The big problem is the internet doesn’t know what skills you have</strong></h1><p>There isn’t a giant Yellow Pages directory that has the list of every global citizen and the skills they possess.</p><p>LinkedIn has some of the data … but it’s not enough.</p><p>So what happens? Everyday people with great skill sets stay <strong>J</strong>ust <strong>O</strong>ver <strong>B</strong>roke and accept the low pay their current employer offers because they can’t easily find higher paying employer-customers. Tragic.</p><p>The only solution to the problem is to post content on social media.</p><p>Now some will rebel and say “I don’t want to be an influencer” or “I’m not a content creator.”</p><p>Yes you are. You have to influence people every day at work to take action in some way. And you’re a content creator if you sent an email, DM, or text message in the last 365 days.</p><p>Social media is the missing piece of the puzzle.</p><p>When you post online future employers or customers can understand what your skills are. They can then contact you to enquire about your services. This is level one.</p><p>The other option is to build a small library of content online and then message potential customers from that social media account to get new opportunities.</p><p>But without social media content you are a skilled ghost nobody will contact.</p><h1><strong>Top employees are the best kind</strong></h1><p>I’ve worked with multiple high-performers in my career.</p><p>Many of them stay working for the same company for 5+ years. What they forget is if they’re a high-performing employee they can easily become a high-performing entrepreneur.</p><p>They’re essentially the same thing.</p><p>Being successful at work means getting results. If you’ve found a way to do it for your current employer, you can probably duplicate the process and do it for a second and third customer. Each will pay you for the privilege.</p><h1><strong>The skill that matters more than business</strong></h1><p>The importance of business skills is overrated in the migration from the one-employer to more-than-one-customer mindset.</p><p>The most important skill is networking.</p><p>Your ability to connect with people and start random conversations determines if you will get exposed to new opportunities.</p><p>And your ability to take social media posts and exploit the credibility they give you to then charge out your skills to new people also matters.</p><p>So if I wanted to find more customers, I’d master sending kickass DMs/emails that get replies, and producing engaging social media posts.</p><h1><strong>Bringing it all together</strong></h1><p>To progress from one customer to many more takes time.</p><p>There are several paths you can take. I chose to sell my 9-5 skills a second time as a consultant, teacher, and later, coach.</p><p>I never told my employer because it’s none of their business. And obviously I didn’t share my employer’s private information or company secrets.</p><p>But I did share my 9-5 skills like the income pro$titute I am. Because I didn’t trust any company to resist the temptation to hand out random redundancies whenever they liked.</p><p>Bottom line: sell your skills at least twice. Get paid at least twice. Now money isn’t such a struggle anymore.</p><p>Tell me which of these ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

If you’re new here, Workforce Wrap Up aims to give a quick 5-minute download of interesting highlights that happened in our labor market / economy in the past month.&nbsp;</p><p>This month, we have some interesting, albeit confusing, data. On one hand, consumer confidence in the labor market has plummeted, there are concerns around an impending childcare cliff and housing shortage, and we had a massive dockworker strike that could’ve been very disruptive. And yet, the labor market surprised us with 254,000 new jobs, stability in layoffs, and an increase in average wages, creating questions about whether the Fed’s 50 bps rate cut was premature.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So with that, let’s dig in.</strong></p><h3><strong>The U.S. crushed expectations, adding 254,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% to 4.1%.&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Forecasts predicted the US only adding 150,000 new jobs last month.

Many try out freemium strategies, but not all SaaS companies can replicate the success of Dropbox or Typeform. Done wrong, freemium can end up cannibalizing your paid user base while also draining your company’s precious engineering and customer support resources. </p><p>In 2019, Typeform's free version attracted about 180,000 new users each month, with a conversion rate of around 3%. Dropbox, on the other hand, successfully transformed its free users into enthusiastic advocates, investing more in engineering than in sales. Both companies used their free options to boost adoption and grow their paid subscriptions, with Dropbox particularly excelling in making enterprise software more accessible to consumers.</p><p>How can you tell if a freemium model, like the ones used by Dropbox or Typeform, is right for your business?</p><p>Let’s discuss some of the pros and cons of the freemium model.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg" width="728" height="407.9859894921191" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/afb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;width&quot;:571,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:25992,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafb3e5ed-23ec-4a61-8f03-793f45ad68a6_571x320.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/freemium/">Wall Street</a></figcaption></figure></div><h4>The downsides of freemium</h4><p>Many SaaS companies are overly optimistic, thinking that offering a free, simplified version of their product will lead to a surge of signups and eventual revenue from paid users. But there are some important downsides to consider: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Added costs</strong>: SaaS businesses usually have high-profit margins, but supporting a large group of free users can eat into those profits. It's not just about server costs—engineering, product development, and customer support all add up. Free users still expect support, and those costs can be significant. For example, Typeform reported that 70% of its support tickets came from free users, costing them $130,000 per month in 2019. For companies with smaller margins or expensive infrastructure, freemium might not be the best fit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cannibalization of paying users</strong>: While the hope is that free users will eventually pay, it doesn't always work that way. Some people who might have paid right away may stick with the free version instead. This can lead to fewer paying customers than expected. I've seen companies roll out a free tier, thinking it will boost sales, only to watch their paid signups drop. Offering a free plan can sometimes backfire by discouraging people from upgrading.</p></li><li><p><strong>Balancing product features</strong>: A freemium model requires a delicate balance. If you give away too much for free, people won’t feel the need to pay. But if you offer too little, no one will sign up. Typeform does this well by limiting free users to surveys with 10 questions and 100 responses, while paid users get unlimited features. Not all companies find this balance as easily.</p></li><li><p><strong>Less focus on core users</strong>: Offering a freemium plan means you’ll likely have way more non-paying users than paying ones. It can be hard to ignore the feedback from users who make up 90–95% of your base, even if their needs are different from those who pay. For example, Evernote, once the poster child of freemium, lost focus on its core users by trying to cater to everyone. This made their product feel stagnant, a mistake they could have avoided.</p></li><li><p><strong>Managing the funnel</strong>: Widening the top of your funnel with free users makes it even more important to identify the best leads efficiently. If you don’t, your most valuable signups might get lost in all the noise.</p></li></ul><h4>The benefits of freemium</h4><p>Most of the challenges with freemium can be managed if your free plan brings in a lot more users, and you can convert enough of them to paying customers. While freemium usually lowers conversion rates, that’s fine if the boost in signups makes up for it. As long as you maintain steady conversions, the freemium model offers several benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>More active users</strong>: One of the toughest hurdles for SaaS companies is getting people to actually use their product. Free trials help, but some users are more likely to stick with the product if it’s free from the start. Others might not sign up at all without a free plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>More brand advocates</strong>: Don’t judge a user’s value only by whether they pay. A bigger user base means more potential advocates who can spread the word about your product. For example, users already familiar with Typeform’s brand were twice as likely to become paying customers. Qwilr noticed a similar trend.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased virality</strong>: The best argument for freemium is if your product has built-in viral potential, like Typeform or Dropbox. However, it’s important to note that free users may not be as active as paying ones, which could lower their impact on referrals. Ideally, you’d design your paywall so free users can still share and drive growth while monetizing other parts of the product.</p></li><li><p><strong>More feedback</strong>: A larger user base also gives you more feedback to work with. Typeform has benefited from learning from a wider audience. Just remember, feedback from free users may or may not be as relevant, depending on your product and market.</p></li><li><p><strong>Re-engaging trial users</strong>: Some users won’t convert to paying customers after a trial ends. A freemium option lets you keep these users engaged, increasing the chances they’ll pay later on.</p></li></ul><h4>Making the decision</h4><p>Now that we've examined the potential benefits and risks of launching a freemium product, how can you determine if it's the right move for your company? The most reliable way to find out is through A/B testing. However, getting solid results can take a long time, especially if you're looking at the impact on virality and your viral cycle is six months or longer. </p><p>If you can't wait that long or aren't set up for a full A/B test, consider these "Three Factors for Freemium Strategy":</p><ol><li><p><strong>Does your paid plan have a gross margin of 80–90%?</strong><br>If you have a lower gross margin — for example because your product is not fully self-service, requires extensive customer support or is extremely costly in terms of tech infrastructure — freemium will probably not work for you.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Does your free plan attract the right audience?</strong><br>If your free users are too different from your paying users, your free-to-paying conversion will be low — and you’ll risk developing your product for the wrong audience.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Is your product inherently viral?</strong><br>If your answer is no, that doesn’t make it a complete no-go, but it does mean that it’s much less likely that freemium is right for you.</p></li></ol><p>In the end, freemium only makes sense if a certain percentage of your free users do one of three things: 1) Eventually convert to paid, 2) refer paying customers, or 3) provide the kind of valuable feedback that will improve your product. A freemium product that fails to achieve any of these effects will merely saddle you with extra costs and distract you from servicing your most important users. </p><div><hr></div><h5><strong>QUICK DIVES</strong></h5><h4><strong>1. </strong>The most important growth metric for early startups.</h4><p>Startups often grapple with choosing the right metrics to focus on. While there are numerous options like user signups, revenue generation, and week-over-week growth, <strong>one metric stands out as crucial for early-stage startups: cohort retention rate.</strong> This metric is a key indicator of your startup's long-term viability and is sometimes even used to define product-market fit. Let's explore why it's so important and how to measure it effectively.</p><p>Many startups make the mistake of calculating retention by looking at their entire user base. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the differences between new and long-standing users. The correct method is to measure retention by cohort - a group of users who joined around the same time.</p><p>To create a cohort retention graph:</p><ol><li><p>Select a group of users who joined within a specific time frame (typically a week or month)</p></li><li><p>Track how many of these users return or perform a key action over time</p></li><li><p>Plot this data on a graph showing the percentage retained over time</p></li></ol><p>If your cohort retention chart looks like below, you’re in good shape!&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

(e.g., days, weeks, months) based on your product's optimal usage frequency</p></li><li><p>Choose a meaningful retention action for the y-axis (e.g., "visited app," "sent message," "booked trip")</p></li><li><p>Create separate graphs for different signup methods (e.g., website vs. app) as they may show different patterns</p></li></ul><p><strong>A critical point on the cohort retention graph is where the curve begins to flatten</strong>. This typically occurs around 5-8 weeks after signup and indicates your long-term cohort retention rate. This number is crucial for several reasons:</p><ol><li><p>It helps estimate the percentage of signups likely to become long-term users</p></li><li><p>It can be used for rough calculations in areas like paid user acquisition</p></li><li><p>It sets a benchmark for evaluating the impact of new features or experiments</p></li></ol><p>Why Retention Matters for Startups</p><ol><li><p>Acquisition vs. Retention: While user acquisition strategies can potentially scale massively (1000x or more), retention strategies typically have a more limited impact (maybe 2x at best).</p></li><li><p>Financial Impact: High retention rates significantly increase your Lifetime Value (LTV) per user, allowing for higher user acquisition costs.</p></li><li><p>Sustainability: Strong retention helps your startup weather periods when user acquisition becomes more challenging.</p></li><li><p>Investor Appeal: Many investors consider retention rates as a key indicator of a startup's potential for long-term success.</p></li></ol><p>In conclusion, while metrics like weekly active users, revenue, and signup rates will fluctuate greatly over time, your retention rate tends to remain relatively stable throughout your startup's lifecycle. That's why it's such a critical metric for early-stage startups to focus on.</p><p>Key Takeaways:</p><ol><li><p>Prioritize cohort retention rate as your most crucial early-stage metric</p></li><li><p>Use cohort analysis to accurately measure your retention rate</p></li><li><p>If your cohort retention graph shows near-zero long-term retention, improving this should be your top growth priority</p></li><li><p>Understand that strong retention rates make every aspect of growing your startup easier</p></li></ol><h4><strong>2.

They're more willing to walk away from suboptimal deals and may eliminate legacy discounts. Square's journey from simple flat pricing to a more nuanced approach as it grew illustrates this evolution, showing how pricing strategy can align with and support a company's overall brand promise and market position.</p><p>However at every stage, <strong>One of the hardest parts of managing pricing is knowing whether or not your strategy is having its desired effect.</strong> The reason for this is simple – for the deals you’ve won, it’s nearly impossible to know how much money you might have left on the table based on the customer’s ultimate willingness to pay, and for deals you’ve lost, it’s possible your product’s functionality, or any number of other complications, might have been the primary culprit. For self-serve pricing, it’s difficult to measure which prospects may have dropped out of the funnel due to pricing vs. which felt they were getting the bargain of the century. The list of complexities goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>At the earliest stages, your analysis is going to be less sophisticated and will likely centre around listening to customer feedback. As your company matures, you’ll have enough data points to analyze wins and losses, customer cohorts, revenue by segment, and other relevant trends. Here <strong>are a few strategies you can employ to get a sense of whether pricing at your company is working as intended:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ongoing competitive reviews and customer surveys:</strong></p><p>Just like you did when outlining your initial pricing strategy, you should continue to track how you price in comparison to your main competitors, and continue to talk to your customers to understand their perception of the value you deliver relative to the price you charge. Some of this feedback may come through via comments in NPS surveys, one-off discussions with account managers or support staff, or other unstructured channels, but we suggest carving out a pricing-specific check-in cadence with a handful of customers from each segment to ensure nothing is too far off the mark.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Routine price increases</strong>:</p><p>This is the simplest method. You can test pricing increases with a few customers. <strong>One popular question especially VCs, like to ask during customer or prospect calls</strong> is whether the buyer of a given piece of software would still use it if the price doubled the following year.</p><p>While this is an entirely hypothetical scenario, there is an opportunity to implement periodic price increases to gauge how much-untapped willingness to pay exists in your customer base. If you’re able to facilitate these increases on a regular basis with limited churn, you have not yet <strong>brushed up against the willingness to pay asymptote for your product.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Variance analysis:</strong></p><p>Create a scatter plot of all your current customers and their average sale price (ASP). When you segment your customers by certain characteristics—account size, region, number of employees, etc.—are you able to glean any insights about which price point has yielded the most success with a given set of customers? If the plot is all over the place, the answer will likely be no, which would indicate pricing has been more or less ad hoc on a deal-by-deal basis. If there’s concentration around certain pricing bands, your strategy is, at a minimum, consistent. An almost equally important part of the exercise is to identify outliers (on the low or high side of the spectrum) and decide whether they should be trued up in either direction. While those paying particularly high prices relative to their segment may allow you to capture more value and generate more revenue, you run the risk of them talking to other customers and losing trust in your business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Price realization</strong>:<br>Create a similar scatter plot to the one mentioned above, but instead of ASPs, express your customers’ pricing in terms of per cent discount to rack rate. What’s your median discount across deals of a certain type? 10%? 40%? 95%? Anything consistently above 50% probably tells you you’re starting too high, especially if discounts of a certain magnitude require explicit sets of approvals (more on this below).</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales efficiency and escalation analysis:</strong><br>Measure the typical number of touchpoints, redline negotiations, and escalations a deal in a given customer segment requires. As you adjust pricing, are you able to observe any impact on how long and arduous it is for sales reps to close deals? If these figures are much more drawn out than your ideal or expected sales cycle, your pricing is likely too high (and vice versa if deals are closing too fast, if there is such a thing!). As you grow, you will look at burn multiple and sales efficiency metrics, which may also signal if the price is too low or high.</p></li></ul><p>Processes like those outlined above may be owned by any number of stakeholders (again, this number is largely dependent upon the company stage). How often you formally revisit pricing is company-specific; for those later-stage companies with dedicated pricing teams, it’s deliberated daily.

And my god are we excited for this. </p><p>He focuses on <strong>pre-seed and seed</strong> investments in three core areas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fintech</strong>: Backing companies driving innovation across all finance sub-verticals, tapping into the potential of AI and cutting-edge technologies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fintech-powered sectors</strong>: From climate tech to healthcare and logistics, Anthony looks for startups leveraging fintech to disrupt and enhance industries far beyond traditional finance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Not-yet Fintech</strong>: Seeking companies that may not be fintech today but have the potential to use fintech as a strategic advantage, whether in their revenue model, customer base, or business approach.</p></li></ul><p>This is one of the biggest and most important episodes we’ve done because we think Anthony will be one of the European venture's true trailblazers.</p><p><em>Watch it here or add it to your episodes on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/euvc/id1544598239">Apple </a>or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0WO5adjTSnzxCC3l2sRq1f">Spotify</a> 🎧 chapters for easy navigation available on the Spotify/Apple episode.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png" width="750" height="40" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:40,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ca142d-62d2-4955-b9b4-e6cb7fc0e5c3_750x40.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Join us for <a href="https://bit.ly/NorthStarGITEX24">Expand North Star in Dubai</a> -

He shares how early experiences in startups, such as leading deals at TrueLayer and Wayflyer, prepared him for launching <em>Rerail.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Venture transformation</strong>: His switch to VC and learning from both European and US markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>The road to Rerail</strong>: His love for early-stage investing and fintech’s vast potential led him to start his fund.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>FinTech is everything: defining the thesis</h2><p>Anthony shares his <em>FinTech is everything</em> philosophy, where fintech isn’t just a vertical but a strategic advantage across various industries. He breaks down his thesis into three key areas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Core FinTech</strong>: Innovating traditional financial services like payments and banking.</p></li><li><p><strong>FinTech-powered sectors</strong>: From healthcare to logistics, using fintech as a revenue model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emerging intersections</strong>: Identifying software companies working with fintech or regulated markets.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Rerail: a fund backed by founders</h2><p>Rerail One is a $20-25M angel fund backed primarily by founders and operators. Anthony discusses the fund’s focus on pre-seed and seed investments, supporting founders at the earliest stages.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check sizes</strong>: $200-500K with collaborative investments at pre-seed and seed stages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Founder relationships</strong>: How Anthony prioritizes trust and support, especially at the angel and friends-and-family rounds.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>The power of networks over domain expertise</h2><p>Anthony emphasizes his <em>network-first</em> approach. Rather than being a domain expert in every aspect of fintech, he leverages deep relationships with founders and operators to gain insights and drive value.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Collaborative edge</strong>: Why co-investing with other VCs and partnering with strong fintech players is key to his strategy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexibility &amp; humility</strong>: Stay open to founders’ insights and the evolving fintech landscape.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Going global: expanding beyond Europe </h2><p>Though Rerail primarily focuses on Europe right now, Anthony shares his plans for expanding globally, tapping into his strong U.S. and international VC network. He sees a long-term opportunity in becoming a more global player.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Global ambitions</strong>: Europe remains the core, but global relationships prepare the way for future opportunities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategic flexibility</strong>: Anthony explains how his fund structure and network position him to grow globally over time.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png" width="700" height="40" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:40,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10d284dd-b5e9-4acd-a2a0-8d1717ad80f4_700x40.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>🤗 Join the EUVC Community</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Looking for niche, high-quality experiences that prioritize depth over breadth?</strong> Consider joining our community focused on delivering content tailored to the experienced VC.

Therefore, no changes, no AI, no nothing has been done to the following sections.</em></p><h2>The Emerald hack of flex-term funds for Corporates</h2><p>Emerald, with a team of 60 employees, including many technical experts, primarily serves corporate LPs seeking both financial returns and strategic insights into sustainability-related technologies. </p><p>To accommodate these needs, Emerald developed a "flex term" structure in 2016, allowing corporations to terminate their investment period anytime after an initial five years. This structure, which Emerald has been using for eight years, doesn't change the investment duration in startups but offers investors more flexibility.</p><h2>Building Emerald &amp; building a franchise</h2><p>Technical depth in the team – we don’t invest in things we don’t understand.</p><p>Understand the risks we are taking – do proper DD even if you get a reputation of being very thorough and slow. When we table a term sheet, we intend to follow through with the investment and very rarely have we ever backed out.</p><p>Partner with the startups – through thick and thin. I don’t mean throwing good money after bad, but startups will hit road bumps, and we need to pull together to get them over those bumps and back on the track to success.</p><h2>Pivotal learnings in your journey</h2><p>Investing in early-stage companies is really exciting and a lot of fun… until it’s not. </p><p>Understand the risks and timelines in early-stage industrial technology companies.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to sit on the sidelines when everyone else is investing like crazy – there is no guarantee that you get out at the same revenue multiples that you got in at. Stay disciplined, even if you have to explain to your investors why you aren’t investing at a higher pace.</p><h2>Deep Dive on your VC and CVC as a Service model and how you work with Corporate Investors</h2><p>We manage 4 active funds (3 flex-term/evergreen and 1 closed-end) and 4 CVCaaS. Roughly EUR 450 M in the funds and EUR 250 M in CVCaaS mandates.</p><p>Fundraising with corporates is a long-term endeavor—typically, it takes them 2 years to get from an internal champion to actually invest in a fund. This is partly because it is not something they do every day and it ties in with their open innovation strategy.</p><h2>Fundraising before and after the #TechReset?</h2><p>Given that our flex-term funds are always open, there is no defined fundraising period. We are always fundraising and never fundraising. Even so, we did see a peak of activity in 2021/2022, and now it is back to a normal pace. </p><h2>Three things that allowed you to be successful.</h2><p>Resilience and dedication. There was certainly a time after the financial crisis when most of our peers closed shop. We revised our strategy and dug in for a rough ride. We were lucky and survived.</p><p>Experience and stability of the team is probably the one aspect that made the difference between success and failure for us.</p><p>”It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it” – be thoughtful in how you treat others (team members, coinvestors, startups) and careful about who you do business with.</p><h2>Core learnings from your last CVC Client raise  and from driving CVC as a Service Model?</h2><p>There are several models that corporates can choose eg only direct, direct and fund investments, only fund investments and CVCaaS (ie outsourcing the investment part). Not every model fits every company and it also changes over time. </p><p>What is clear is that corporates who are doing direct investments which have little impact on their business (whether core or new business) will likely not survive. </p><p>At some point, someone is going to ask why this activity exists because even if they are financially successful, it is just a rounding error in a multi billion dollar corporate’s financials.</p><h2>A look at the person behind – Who is Gina Domanig?</h2><ul><li><p>Fairness </p></li><li><p>Good judgement </p></li><li><p>Building talent is the most important job of the CEO.</p></li></ul><h2>VC animosity to corporates &amp; tech bro culture</h2><p>Gina shared her perspective on the relationship between venture capital (VC) and corporate worlds, contrasting with the sometimes adversarial "tech bro culture" view. She emphasized the importance of startups partnering with corporations rather than trying to compete directly.</p><p>Gina believes that leveraging corporate strengths can reduce risk and increase success probability for startups without diminishing their value. She pointed out that most exits in the past 25 years have been through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) rather than IPOs, highlighting the importance of building relationships with potential corporate acquirers early on. </p><p>Gina disagrees with the notion that "companies are bought, not sold," arguing that the selling process begins early through relationship-building. She advocates for startups to maintain multiple corporate relationships and have diverse corporate investors on their cap table to improve the chances of a successful exit.</p><h2>Advice to young people in the industry</h2><ul><li><p>Don’t get caught up in the hype. For example:</p><ul><li><p>1) A unicorn is just a company that someone decided to give money to at a very high valuation. If it doesn’t mean that anyone did or will make money from the investment. </p></li><li><p>2) Awards for making the most investments are silly—anyone can make investments. The hard part is getting your money back. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Market standards are just a reflection of what was done in the past. Dare to do what you think is the right thing to do – that’s how standards evolve.</p></li><li><p>This is a collaborative industry built on interdependencies. Don’t burn bridges, help your peers, make a contribution to improving the ecosystem and it will come back to you in spades.</p></li></ul><h2>The most counterintuitive learning</h2><p>Don’t invest if you don’t have to. </p><p>If you can achieve your strategic goals, such as a commercial agreement, without having to make an investment, then save your cash for something else.</p><div

to achieve&nbsp;their&nbsp;net zero goals</a>&nbsp;unless they&nbsp;double the pace of emissions reduction by 2030.&nbsp;This is challenging due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of primary value chain data, the

Therefore, no changes, no AI, no nothing has been done to the following sections.</em></p><h3>Blaise’s journey as an angel investor.</h3><p>I was 27 years old, and for me, it was super important to think about what I could do after. As an athlete, especially if you are a soccer player when your active years come to an end, you realize your career has to change.</p><p>My father always told me, «<em>You need to prepare yourself!</em>»</p><p>I wanted to do something for my kids and try my best.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Why Blaise became the GP of a venture capital fund.</h3><p>We always start from something, right?</p><p>I started as a business angel, and this is how I got the chance to meet some people, and one of my Partners now at Origin. We felt the desire to bring together both of our worlds, and I realized I can provide added-value to companies through social media, and help companies enhance their communication power. We, now represent an audience of 160M and our athletes are recognized worldwide.</p><p>I sport, I always liked that together we are stronger, and I think there is a huge value in connecting athletes with the business world. </p><div><hr></div><h3>Salomon on discipline and work ethic.</h3><p>The life of an athlete looks glamorous from the outside. You go to a stadium, watch a game, then watch his lifestyle on Instagram, and everything looks glamorous.</p><p>But, it’s more than that, it’s about the work ethic those people have and the discipline to be the best. </p><p>For example, when we have a partner meeting at Origin, and Blaise is driving the team to what matters most. Our job is to invest, so if we haven’t seen new companies in December, we have to focus on that no matter what.</p><p>So, life can look glamorous from the outside, but deep down, it requires strong work ethic, discipline, and mental resilience to become the best. </p><h3>Salomon on why the consumer sector is the underdog in the VC world.</h3><p>A legendary VC told me that being a consumer investor is the best way to have a short career in the industry.</p><p>Consumer is really hard, and we are aware of that. That’s why we given the high-profile of our LPs, right now, we, and the entire team has an immense amount of pressure to not only return the money to our LPs, but returning a really high-value. </p><p>The way we structure our portfolio is to “derisk” what consumer means. </p><p>I just looked at a company today, who has crazy numbers in retention. But in the end I am asking myself what is this company gonna look like in 6-months or a year from now? It’s gonna be just another Clubhouse?

Therefore, no changes, no AI, no nothing has been done to the following sections.</em></p><h3>Blaise’s journey as an angel investor.</h3><p>I was 27 years old, and for me, it was super important to think about what I can do after. As an athlete, especially if you are a soccer player when your active years come to an end, you realize your career has to change.</p><p>My father always told me, «<em>You need to prepare yourself!</em>»</p><p>I wanted to do something for my kids and try my best.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Why Blaise became the GP of a venture capital fund.</h3><p>We always start from something, right?</p><p>I started as a business angel, and this is how I got the chance to meet some people, and one of my Partners now at Origin. We felt the desire to bring together both of our worlds, and I realized I can provide added-value to companies through social media, and help companies enhance their communication power. We, now represent an audience of 160M and our athletes are recognized worldwide.</p><p>I sport, I always liked that together we are stronger, and I think there is a huge value in connecting athletes with the business world. </p><div><hr></div><h3>Salomon on discipline and work ethic.</h3><p>The life of an athlete looks glamorous from the outside. You go to a stadium, watch a game, then watch his lifestyle on Instagram, and everything looks glamorous.</p><p>But, it’s more than that, it’s about the work ethic those people have and the discipline to be the best. </p><p>For example, when we have a partners meeting at Origin, and Blaise is driving the team to what matters most. Our job is to invest, so if we haven’t seen new companies in December, we have to focus on that no matter what.</p><p>So, life can look glamorous from the outside, but deep down, it requires a strong work ethic, discipline, and mental resilience to become the best. </p><h3>Salomon on why the consumer sector is the underdog in the VC world.</h3><p>A legendary VC told me that being a consumer investor is the best way to have a short career in the industry.</p><p>Consumer is really hard, and we are aware of that. That’s why we given the high-profile of our LPs, right now, we, and the entire team has an immense amount of pressure to not only return the money to our LPs, but returning a really high-value. </p><p>The way we structure our portfolio is to “derisk” what consumer means. </p><p>I just looked at a company today, who has crazy numbers in retention. But in the end I am asking myself what is this company gonna look like in 6-months or a year from now? It’s gonna be just another Clubhouse? It’s going to be another company in the market?</p><p>I think consumer is very binary, and we’re building the portfolio by taking a risk on binary bets.</p><div

Scania&nbsp;Invest,&nbsp;and Beacon Venture Capital.</p><p>CAMBRIDGE, UK,&nbsp;Oct. 3, 2024<a href="http://www.neutreeno.com/">—Neutreeno</a>, a pioneering deep tech startup based at the University of Cambridge, has secured a $5 million Seed round with support from a global syndicate of mission-aligned investors.&nbsp;</p><p>On average,&nbsp;companies&nbsp;have&nbsp;over&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;emissions&nbsp;in&nbsp;their value chain (Scope3),&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

to achieve&nbsp;their&nbsp;net zero goals</a>&nbsp;unless they&nbsp;double the pace of emissions reduction by 2030.&nbsp;This is challenging due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of primary value chain data, the inability to influence suppliers, and the high cost of decarbonization.</p><p>Neutreeno’s proprietary process networks, based on mass and energy flow research, significantly minimize the primary data burden on suppliers and allow enterprises to map product lines faster and with greater precision than existing tools.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;easy-to-use&nbsp;and affordable&nbsp;digital system&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;pinpoints solutions that reduce&nbsp;emissions and costs&nbsp;across 1,000s of suppliers.&nbsp;Neutreeno’s customers span Europe, North America and Asia, including S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 250 companies across multiple industries and a wide range of SMEs.</p><p>Fredrik&nbsp;Nilzén, Head of Sustainability at Scania Group,&nbsp;one

This key video kicked off what is now a $250 billion creator economy. The rapid growth of the creator economy in the past 10 years has sparked the interest of investors and policymakers around the world. In August, President Biden held the first creator economy conference at the White House, inviting 100 influencers and reinforcing the growing legitimacy of this industry. Social media has revolutionized media and entertainment as we know it, with immense hype surrounding the subject during the pandemic years. Yet, now that this hype is beginning to fade, is there anything substantiating the claim that the creator economy will reach almost half a trillion dollars by 2027, as anticipated by Goldman Sachs, or will it be a fleeting gimmick driven by a frenzy of Gen Zs?</p><h3><strong>❓What is The Creator Economy &amp;&nbsp;Why is it Relevant?</strong></h3><p>The creator economy allows&nbsp;individuals to use digital platforms to produce, distribute, and monetize content while building interactive communities. Unlike traditional media, creators rely on relatability and viewer engagement, making them more accessible than Hollywood celebrities. This shift has democratized information, with the decentralized content economy promoting greater transparency. Social media also addresses issues like pay transparency, and startups like "F*ck You Pay Me" empower creators to share brand deal payments, promoting fairness in the workplace.</p><h3>&nbsp;📹 <strong>From Dinner Party to Digital Empire: How YouTube Ignited a Creative Revolution</strong></h3><p>Content creation began in 2005 with YouTube, originally for sharing videos among friends, and quickly grew to 25 million users by 2006. In 2007, YouTube’s Partner Program enabled creators to earn revenue, transforming hobbies into jobs. By 2021, 57% of Gen Z aspired to be content creators. The creator economy surged during the pandemic, growing at a 22% CAGR and producing 17 unicorns between 2020 and 2022. While investment dropped from $10 billion in 2021 to $1.7 billion in 2023, funding in 2024 is already outpacing 2023, reflecting social media's vast impact on culture and business.</p><h3>🍭&nbsp;<strong>A Lingering Addiction</strong></h3><p>The content on platforms like TikTok is not just engaging—it’s addictive. Wall Street analysts compare&nbsp;TikTok’s algorithm to crack cocaine, triggering endorphin releases every 15 seconds by serving viral videos.&nbsp;<br><br>In the U.S:</p><ul><li><p>Daily mobile usage is 3 hours 30 minutes, with time on TikTok rising from 27 minutes in 2019 to 58 minutes in 2024, as teens now spend 2 hours a day on the platform, compared to 40 minutes on YouTube and less on others.</p></li><li><p>Reels account for 25% of Instagram time, while YouTube Shorts has 2 billion users.</p></li></ul><p>Social media is replacing traditional news for younger users who prefer quick, digestible content. In the U.S., more people under 35 seek financial advice from "finfluencers" than traditional professionals, as knowledge that once had high barriers is now widely accessible. This can lead to misinformation and reduced critical thinking, as important information is condensed into 15-second recaps without sources or fact-checking. This digital addiction also affects academics and mental health, with students struggling to focus and experiencing increased stress, cognitive fatigue, and a higher risk of anxiety and burnout.</p><h3>🔎 <strong>Reference Capital Creator Economy Landscape</strong></h3><p>The creator&nbsp;economy's growth and global influence present numerous opportunities to leverage its potential.<br><br>After analyzing hundreds of creator economy startups, we identified 215 promising companies across key verticals, providing a full overview of the creative process, tools, services, and technologies from creator to consumer. The journey, mapped from left to right, starts with content creation and editing, moves through publishing and engagement, and leads to community building. As creators gain traction, intermediaries offer services or connect them with brands for monetization, supported by operational tools that keep the creator economy running.<br><br>Note that although major social platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch are central to the creator economy, we have excluded them from our mapping to focus on emerging players that could be acquisition targets for these giants, as exemplified by Spotify's acquisition of Chartable and Podsights in 2022 and Adobe's purchase of ContentCal in 2021.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png" width="1456" height="875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:875,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28a4d250-d408-4b3a-a4ea-a532db83a9f4_2134x1282.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Here are the key takeaways from the mapping for each category:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Content Creation:</strong>&nbsp;Content editing and creation form the foundation of the creator economy, with many established companies supporting this space, even if not exclusively targeting creators. AI is increasingly used to generate media, translate content, and convert text into visuals. Virtual influencers, like Lu do Magalu who earns $33,000 per post, highlight AI’s role, though it cannot replace the authenticity of human creators.<br>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Community Building:</strong>&nbsp;Startups focused on fan engagement attract less investment, as monetization tools are prioritized. However, building strong audience connections is critical for long-term success.<br>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Intermediary:</strong>&nbsp;Intermediaries help creators secure brand deals, with 70% of creator income stemming from brand partnerships.<br>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Off-Platform Monetization:</strong>&nbsp;Monetization avenues include both on-platform earnings and off-platform revenue. In terms of on-platform revenue, YouTube offers a 45-55 revenue split, allowing creators to earn $2-$12 per 1,000 views. Top creators, like Mr. Beast, reported $82M in revenue last year. Additionally, creators with over 50,000 followers can charge upwards of $3,000 per post. Brands see a return on investment of $6.50 for every dollar spent on influencer marketing, compared to $2 per dollar spent on Google Ads. Due to less favorable payout terms and the challenges of monetizing short-form content, many creators are shifting their focus to off-platform revenue streams for more stable and predictable income. Off-platform monetization includes earnings from auxiliary platforms like purchasable content, commerce, and fan-driven revenue. Expanding off-platform monetization is key to stabilizing the creator economy and attracting further investment.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png" width="1391" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:1391,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29f90fb6-f75b-4c6d-af12-809594f8d3d7_1391x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Source: eMarketer, March 2024</em></figcaption></figure></div><h3><strong>💸 Where's the Money Going?</strong></h3><p>After a funding peak in 2021 and a sharp drop in 2022-2023, the creator economy is rebounding in 2024, with more invested capital&nbsp;in the first half than all of 2023. Notable startups include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dude Perfect</strong>, raising $100M from Highmount Capital to expand its media presence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Duetti</strong>, raising $83M from Nyca Partners to help small music creators monetize by buying catalog rights.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beehiiv</strong>, a newsletter platform, raising $29M in Q2 2024, reaching a $200M valuation led by NEA.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>🚧 Challenges for the Creator Economy</strong></h3><p><strong>Monetization Challenges:</strong>&nbsp;Monetization for creators is often unstable, with income reliant on multiple fragmented streams like platform payouts, brand deals, and fan contributions. Changes in platform policies or a decline in audience engagement can lead to inconsistent earnings, making it difficult for creators to achieve long-term financial stability.</p><p><strong>Content Turnover:</strong>&nbsp;The industry's fast pace and unpredictable algorithms render trends and success fleeting, often reliant on timing. Social capital can vanish quickly, as seen with Shane Dawson in 2020. Creators typically remain relevant for only 5-7 years, and startups like Poparazzi and Vine demonstrate the short-lived nature of success.</p><p><strong>Attracting Big Creators:</strong>&nbsp;Startups depend on major creators to attract others, but losing them or facing cancellations can significantly impact the business.</p><p><strong>Simplicity of Tools:</strong>&nbsp;Easy-to-use platforms are essential, as many creators lack technical expertise. Simple tools foster loyalty and reduce competition.</p><p><strong>Legal Framework:</strong>&nbsp;The potential 2025 TikTok ban and misinformation concerns highlight the need for regulations to protect consumers, especially younger audiences.</p><p><strong>🔮 Reference Viewpoint &amp; Expectations</strong><br><br>The creator economy, once seen as a gimmick for teens, has rapidly grown and diversified, becoming a major industry across all demographics. Its democratization of information and low barriers to entry have shifted the landscape from traditional media. Now that the initial hype has faded, investments&nbsp;in the sector are evolving.<br><br>Success depends on attracting creators organically, meaning only startups addressing critical needs will survive. While investment trends show promise, the industry faces challenges like social capital volatility, short-lived viral content, and sustaining long-term creator revenue.<br><br>By providing robust financial infrastructure—including fiscal services, targeted investments, and diversified monetization pathways—the creator economy can stabilize, attract further investments, and mitigate the volatility often associated with the sector. </p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" width="1100" height="220" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Wanna be featured on eu.vc?

With over 27y of firm history, our team at Earlybird has invested in hundreds of companies and we’ve conducted regular post-mortems on the failed ones, all confirming above statement: <strong>Team is the most prominent reason for failure</strong>. </p><p>Double-clicking on team as the primary reason for failure, we find everything from lack of execution to hiring mistakes. Yet, the <strong>most frequent reason for failure is team conflicts</strong>. </p><p>As a result, experienced investors spend significant time with team DD, be it by spending time together with the founders and their leadership or by referencing them across their networks. In the absence of quantitative and tangible performance data, this is particularly true in the earlier stages.</p><p>Obviously, these team DDs are rarely clear cut and it’s a lot about gut feeling. While red flags are rare, it’s incredibly important to be sensible for yellow/orange flags. How does the team interact with each other? Does one always talk and give direction? Do they disagree, and if so, how? </p><p>Being a more quantitative person by nature, getting a sense for team dynamics and trusting my gut has been one of the areas where I probably learned the most as an investor. Despite the learning curve, however, I continued to ask myself over the years whether there was a more objective approach to this problem…</p><p>Fast forward to summer 2022, I joined a panel at a research conference and learned about two interesting research streams that sparked my interest:</p><ol><li><p>Prof Youyou Wu presented her groundbreaking work on how to predict big five character trades for people based on their social media profiles.

What they talk about is up to them. Rossiter gives the example of one user called Philip, who has a brain injury and has been discussing his love of poetry and heavy metal.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversations are then summarised automatically so carers and families can get to know the user better. This helps carers build a bond they might not have time to cultivate otherwise, while giving families insights they might not pick up on otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>In the example of Philip, Rossiter says Lola has changed his life. He says it has inspired Philip to leave the home more regularly than he used to, as he’s joined a writing course, inspired by his conversations using the app.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Lola for Carers app is designed to save care workers time. Instead of sitting down to type up their daily reports, they can speak them into the app and let the software convert their words into formal reports for their records and separate reports for families.</p><p>The app can help with carers’ wellbeing, too.</p><p>“There's a ‘have a moan’ function, where they can vent after a hard day. There's some positive-affirmation quizzes about fellow carers that keeps them motivated throughout the day as they're entering reports,” says Rossiter.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg" width="950" height="776" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:776,&quot;width&quot;:950,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac91527f-16f6-4bec-a663-7e9ae90373f1_950x776.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Lola for Carers encourages carers to privately vent to the app.</em></p><p>The Lola for Families app uses input from the individual in care to build a timeline of memories and experiences from their life. This is particularly valuable in cases of dementia, Rossiter says:</p><p>“With dementia, we allow our customers to build their life story, which is scientifically proven to assist them in their journey of dementia, to have their life story documented, to be in charge of their life story…</p><p>“We also allow them to reminisce and talk about their memories. Reminiscence therapy is a proven intervention for people with dementia, to improve their cognitive function, enhance emotional wellbeing, and slow down the disease's progression.”</p><p>Lola Cares is a B2B SaaS offering aimed at care organisations. Customers can subscribe to whichever combination of the three products best fits their needs.</p><p>In the future, Leaf AI plans to launch the family life story building feature as a consumer product.</p><h2><strong>The story so far</strong></h2><p>Rossiter says that Leaf AI’s origins are rooted in his father’s 70th birthday, eight years ago.</p><p>“He led a really interesting life. He was a professional footballer in Australia; he was an actor in London; he was a bricklayer in New Zealand. He’s done all these mad things, like, he's 70 now. How do I collect all of those stories and pass them on to my son?”</p><p>This led to Leaf’s original idea, a low-cost tablet computer dedicated to the job of collecting memories (“like leaves on a family tree”) to create the user’s life story.</p><p>But while a nice idea, it proved sub-optimal in reality.</p><p>“Once we gave the tablet computers to older people, we realised that they were not that interested in sitting there and typing their life story. It's actually quite a poor experience,” Rossiter says.</p><p>Leaf had previously given <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theadamgalloway/?utm_source=preseednow.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fighting-a-global-public-health-concern-with-conversational-ai">Adam Galloway</a></em> his first job as a software developer, and he and Rossiter had a discussion about dementia and reminiscence therapy. This led to a rethink, and Galloway came back on board as a co-founder of Leaf’s new AI and chatbot focused approach.</p><p>Now a team of seven, and having signed up a care provider in Liverpool as its first customer, Leaf AI is looking to onboard more customers across the care sector.&nbsp;</p><p>The startup is currently part of the latest cohort of the University of Edinburgh’s <em><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/accelerating-entrepreneurship/ai-accelerator?utm_source=preseednow.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fighting-a-global-public-health-concern-with-conversational-ai">AI Accelerator programme</a></em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Leaf AI is also gearing up for the launch of its consumer product, which is aimed at families of people in the earlier stages of dementia.</p><p><a href="https://preseednow.com/p/leaf-ai-lola-cares">Read the full story on PreSeed Now. </a></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" width="1100" height="220" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Wanna be featured on eu.vc?

Buoyed by optimism and a bullish market, the post-pandemic funding heights often set companies up with a comfortable two-or three-year runway. Fast forward to today, and those funds (even if managed conservatively) are nearing exhaustion. A recent report from Morgan Stanley has underscored this reality, indicating that <strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3a6af52a-7eec-434b-bb14-f590b9fef5a7?mod=article_inline">more than 50% of unicorns</a></strong> will need to seek additional capital before the year's end.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with the pressure mounting to raise new capital, startups face a critical reckoning: what progress has been made since the last funding round? Has their growth rate remained steady or accelerated? Have they met or surpassed their forecasts? And perhaps most importantly, have economic headwinds elongated sales cycles for their products or services? For many, the responses to these lines of inquiry will likely be “flat, steady, not met, elongated,” not exactly the winning ‘VC Bingo’ card investors seek.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png" width="1456" height="445" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6434185f-9661-4c82-9df0-9466a68631af_1505x460.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:445,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Median cash runway (in months) by revenue band and start-up category.

Now the roles have reversed: investors are increasingly seeking more for less. For startups seeking fresh capital, the road to raising will likely be far longer, tougher, and more competitive than before. As the funding ecosystem faces constraints and runways come to a halt, it is a sad inevitability that many will not raise again, often marking their end.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png" width="1456" height="677" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:677,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Source: Saddling up for the unicorn massacre, Financial Times, October 2023&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Source: Saddling up for the unicorn massacre, Financial Times, October 2023" title="Source: Saddling up for the unicorn massacre, Financial Times, October 2023" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9237d572-f043-4b23-9e79-3e3bbfca532c_4085x1900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Saddling up for the unicorn massacre, Financial Times, October 2023</figcaption></figure></div><p>What may be of some comfort amid this gloom is to consider the cyclical nature of what we face today. Reflecting on the dot-com bubble and the post-covid heights of 2021, it’s hard not to draw comparisons between the two. Through-the-roof valuations, widely unprofitable business models and (often) first-time founders. While the bursting of the dot-com bubble saw the demise of many, this period too saw the emergence of industry behemoths, the likes of Amazon, eBay and Nvidia, that still exist today. Arguably, in times of hardship, only those with excellent product-market fit, a clear route to profitability and an adaptable leadership team can weather the storm. Those who do emerge will have gleaned invaluable lessons, setting them up for enduring success.</p><p>The bursting of a bubble, too, can mark a turning point for the funding ecosystem. With VCs and investors coming away with a heightened sense of prudence, they begin to embrace a more cautious and discerning approach to investment, implementing thorough due diligence processes and a more diversified portfolio. A decline in “VC tourism” leaves founders better placed to work with investors whose expertise and resources can provide meaningful support and strategic guidance beyond an initial funding injection.</p><p>Growth investors are now laser-focused on discerning a glimmer of hope amid the tunnel of cash burn. With increased scrutiny, founders need to be ready to demonstrate what they have achieved and provide proof and metrics as to how they have reached their inflection point. So, what’s the road ahead for start-up founders and management teams? Here’s my advice.</p><h4><strong>Focus on the Fundamentals:</strong></h4><p>Investors have and will shift their focus from speculative hype to fundamentals. We will see increased emphasis on profitability, sustainable growth, and viable business models rather than solely relying on user acquisition and market share. The coveted unicorn status, once a metric that demarcated companies destined for longevity and success, has lost its glitz. Once rare, unicorns are now commonplace, and the susceptibility to being crowned or de-crowned at the whim of investors has seen many argue for other more robust metrics to be used as proxies for success. As <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/the-age-of-the-centaur-100m-arr-is-the-new-cloud-valuation-milestone/">one article highlights</a></strong>, founders need to ditch their unicorn dreams and instead focus on centaur status, “reaching the $100 million ARR threshold that connotes having the product, go-to-market and operational competencies to endure.”</p><h4><strong>Know your product (and your market):</strong></h4><p>Obvious but paramount. For founders raising in the current climate, knowing your customers and how your product meets and solves their needs is key. With shifting consumer behaviour and evolving market dynamics, anecdotes and superstitions are not enough; founders need clear, actionable data to serve as the foundation of roadmaps and explanations as to what and where funds deployed will be spent. A strong grasp of product-market fit informs resource allocation, prioritisation, and iteration decisions, optimising offerings and driving sustainable growth. In essence, founders equipped with this insight not only weather storms but are equally poised and confident to capitalise on emerging opportunities.</p><h4><strong>Don’t dread the down round:</strong></h4><p>The bursting of the bubble led to a much-needed correction in the market. It brought valuations back to more realistic levels, separating sustainable business models from speculative ventures. This rationalisation laid the foundation for more stable growth in the tech industry. While, with the exception of AI, the ecosystem appears divided into haves and have-nots, the optimal strategy for founders is simple: raise a pragmatic amount of capital that can sustain the business until it achieves cash flow breakeven and beyond. All sounds easy enough until you factor valuations into the equation. Straddling the line between art and science and predicated on growth trajectories and profit margins, pricing is a challenging task for investors and founders alike. However, ensuring each round is priced correctly is a crucial part of the funding cycle.</p><p>Part of this process, is understanding when and why to take a down round. Increasingly, I am seeing puzzling scenarios where founders are pushing to draw a line in the sand from the high watermarks of 2021 and entertain the notion of a down round. Their existing investors, however, staunchly resist, fearing the repercussions on their own performance metrics and subsequent fund raises.</p><p>So why consider taking a cut to a valuation? If priced fairly, a down round offers a silver lining. It not only allows new investors to enter at sensible valuations but also (and arguably more importantly) resets the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), ensuring that employees' options aren't rendered worthless, keeping their skin in the game with future wealth incentivization. Instead, the prevailing trend sees companies clinging to lofty valuations, opting instead to take on complex structures like liquidation preferences and minimum return thresholds. This proverbial kicking the can-down-the-road approach is shortsighted and merely postpones the inevitable, delaying the much-needed <strong>reset</strong> that could propel the company forward.</p><p>This isn’t to say we should encourage markdowns at any cost, and ultimately, any savvy founder wants to keep their investors happy. Flexibility, when occurring on both sides of the table, can foster a more harmonious and ultimately more profitable ecosystem for everyone. As long-term, patient investors, we advocate for a path characterised by clean terms, minimal structure, and transparent, sensibly priced rounds. Such an approach fosters alignment across management teams and investors, paving the way for sustainable growth and meaningful exits.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" width="1100" height="220" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Wanna be featured on eu.vc?

At the core of its mission is a powerful idea: diagnosing cancer as early as possible can drastically improve survival rates.</p><p>But OXcan isn’t just focused on early detection; they’re making it accessible, convenient, and affordable to the general population. They leverage a blood test focused on protein detection for early cancer detection combining a state of art proteomics and machine learning platform.

This reactive approach however can lead to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options are limited, and success rates drop drastically. Today, <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics-for-the-uk">almost half (46%)</a> of all cancers are diagnosed at Stages 3 and 4 in the UK.</p><p>OXcan is flipping this approach. Their vision is rooted in the concept of “early biomarkers”—proteins traces in the blood that indicate the presence of cancer long before it’s detectable by traditional imaging. The WHO estimates that diagnosing cancer at the early stages of its development r<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/03-02-2017-early-cancer-diagnosis-saves-lives-cuts-treatment-costs">educes costs by 2-4x</a>, compared with late-stage diagnoses.</p><p>Their three pronged approach of (1) cancer expertise, (2) focus on multi-omics, and (3) machine learning enables them to enable curative cancer treatment through early detection.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png" width="1456" height="323" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:323,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:114920,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80739a06-ccc4-4962-aab5-757752ea6f96_1994x442.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">OXcan website</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Comparing pathways: the traditional vs. OXcan model</h3><p>The current public health pathway for cancer screening is resource-intensive and often delayed.

A test with high sensitivity minimizes false negatives, ensuring most cases are caught.</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>specificity</strong> refers to a test’s ability to identify true negatives—those who don’t have the condition. High specificity reduces false positives, preventing healthy individuals from being mistakenly diagnosed.

Hassabis and Jumper developed AlphaFold, an AI model capable of predicting the structure of almost every known protein—a breakthrough that has massive implications for medicine, vaccines, and various humanitarian applications. </p><p>Launched in 2020, AlphaFold has transformed fields like drug discovery by accelerating the previously labor-intensive protein-folding research. This prize validates the significance of AlphaFold’s contributions and highlights the Nobel committee's gradual acknowledgment of AI's impact on traditionally distinct sciences.</p><p>Lomax and Mads emphasized the need to “handle AI with care,” similar to other transformative technologies like nuclear power. They support pushing AI innovation forward but stress the importance of balanced regulation to avoid stifling potential advancements. </p><p>Mads pointed out that while AI drives a new “industrial revolution,” excessive regulatory controls—especially within Europe—could hamper progress and international competitiveness. This sentiment was echoed with references to the regulatory freedom available in other regions, like the limited AI access in Hong Kong, which contrasts starkly with Europe’s heavier regulatory approach.</p><h3>Will AI or the DOJ Crack Google’s Search Monopoly?</h3><p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/justice-department-google-breakup-search-engine-dominance/">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is moving to dismantle Google’s search dominance, aiming to separate its search function from other Alphabet entities. </a></p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: With Google controlling 90% of global search traffic, this move intends to enable more competition. Yet, the rise of AI-driven search platforms like GPT, Perplexity, and Claude suggests that technological shifts might be naturally weakening Google’s hold.</p><p>The DOJ’s antitrust action could signal a pivotal moment for tech monopolies, with implications for how Big Tech operates both in the U.S. and abroad. However, with AI alternatives rapidly evolving, some argue that Google’s dominance might erode naturally as users turn to AI-based options. Andreas and others now start their searches with AI, while competitors are also gaining ground by offering more conversational, context-aware responses.</p><p>Mads pointed out that Google’s vast data reservoir, especially from sources like YouTube, uniquely positions it to challenge OpenAI. But if regulators split up Google, the AI landscape could quickly tilt in favor of OpenAI, as Google would lose its edge in competing with such powerful data.</p><p>Lomax further noted that VCs often support companies with monopolistic potential, but there’s a balance to maintain. The question remains: Should regulators let the market forces play out rather than intervene?</p><h3>Rising UK Borrowing Costs: What’s the Impact on Startups and Venture Capital?</h3><p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b9ec4fd-2fca-4962-87b8-2acc3b514359">UK borrowing costs are rising, stoking market concerns as the government faces with mounting debt. </a></p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: While not yet at the unsustainable levels seen under former Prime Minister Liz Truss, this trend has investors watching closely. Higher borrowing costs directly impact the economic environment for startups and venture capital. As government borrowing increases, competition for available capital often drives up interest rates. </p><p>For UK startups, this could mean tighter access to financing as investors become more cautious with riskier assets. Higher interest rates make debt more expensive, potentially reducing the number of venture deals and leading VCs to scrutinize investments more critically. The ripple effects could also tighten budgets for startups already facing a challenging fundraising climate, especially those in the early stages.</p><h3>Pension funds push for more UK borrowing.</h3><p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa692bf4-509d-4e84-a502-f2b1cd0cc3e4">UK pension funds are urging the government to borrow more and loosen restrictions on co-investing in large-scale infrastructure projects. </a></p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: This move, backed by figures like Rachel Reeves, would allow pension funds to direct billions into critical infrastructure, potentially attracting significant international capital.</p><p>Changing the co-investment rules could unlock a flood of capital for infrastructure, boost the UK economy, and drive societal benefits. Beyond roads and bridges, this capital injection could have knock-on effects on the startup ecosystem, both directly and indirectly. Large infrastructure projects often spur innovation, create new markets, and provide opportunities for tech startups focused on everything from clean energy to smart cities. Additionally, the influx of international capital could enhance the broader investment climate, potentially making more funding available for startups across various sectors.</p><p>As Lomax and Mads discussed, this capital injection would likely ripple into the startup ecosystem, indirectly benefiting tech-driven sectors such as clean energy and urban innovation. However, Mads emphasized that merely increasing funding won’t suffice without meaningful reforms to streamline high-cost planning processes.</p><h3>Will the UK’s new regulatory innovation office drive economic growth?</h3><p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1b13556-27c2-481d-bc7e-8901c20a8d26">The UK government has launched the Regulatory Innovation Office, a new department to expedite approvals for emerging technologies in biotech, space, and autonomous vehicles. </a></p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Speeding up regulatory approvals could give the UK a competitive edge in high-growth industries, enabling innovations to reach the market faster. This streamlined approach offers a clear path to market for startups and VCs, reducing the regulatory bottlenecks that can deter investment in risky or experimental technologies. The focus on sectors like biotech and autonomous vehicles signals the UK’s commitment to nurturing cutting-edge industries that require regulatory clarity to thrive. Faster approvals could lead to quicker scaling, attracting local and international investors eager to support high-potential tech.</p><p>During the discussion, Mads emphasized the importance of approvals and addressing “regulatory overhang” from outdated, cumbersome rules. He pointed out that if the office simply adds layers without meaningful simplification, it risks becoming another underfunded body rather than a true accelerator for innovation.</p><p>However, Mads and Lomax expressed skepticism about whether this new office will be adequately resourced and empowered to make a lasting impact. They argued that, for real economic growth, the office would need political and financial support beyond just the next few months or electoral cycles, emphasizing a sustained commitment over a quick fix.</p><h2>Will LPs get back into VC in 2025?</h2><p><strong>What it is:</strong> <a href="https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/lps-are-you-still-grumpy-about-vc">Venture Capital Journal has launched this year's poll testing LP appetite for investing in venture.</a></p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The poll reveals potential headwinds for VC fundraising. In last year’s survey, nearly half of LPs expected only moderate performance from their VC portfolios in 2024, while 42% avoided first-time managers—a twofold increase. Additionally, 24% of LPs reported overallocation to VC, and interest in adding new VCs reached a historic low of 30%. This shift could significantly impact first-time funds and emerging GPs, who may face a tougher environment for securing capital in 2025.</p><p>These challenges and lower enthusiasm for late-stage and growth strategies signal a potential cooling in VC demand globally. However, the results are skewed toward institutional investors like insurance companies, funds of funds, and pension funds, so they might not fully capture appetite in other LP segments, such as family offices, which may still see VC as a key diversification tool.</p><p>Mads noted this pullback could make fundraising for first-time funds and emerging managers even tougher in 2025, as LPs seem more inclined toward established names perceived as safer. </p><p>Lomax highlighted that many institutional investors remain cautious, partly because of the surge in non-traditional, "tourist" LPs in 2021. With these less experienced investors retreating, the burden falls back onto more traditional LPs, who tend to be selective and wary of adding new, untested managers.</p><h2>Does startup ownership and location matter?</h2><p><strong>What it is:</strong> Some&nbsp;big&nbsp;European Series Bs were announced—<a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/dexory_secures_80m_series_b_funding_to_support_global_expansion/dexory">Dexory</a>, <a href="https://bebeez.eu/2024/10/09/ai-startup-poolside-raises-500m-series-b/">Poolside</a>, and <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/news/newcleo-secures-more-than-e535m-in-investment-ahead-of-hq-move-to-paris">Newcleo</a>—but are they European?</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: These relocations highlight the complexity of defining “European” startups in a globalized venture landscape. As companies increasingly straddle international borders to optimize for talent, capital, or regulatory benefits, rigid geographical definitions may seem less relevant. For VCs and the startup ecosystem, what matters most may not be ownership or HQ location but rather where the company is making meaningful economic contributions, driving innovation, and creating jobs. Europe’s strategic relevance remains strong if it continues to attract, retain, and grow such companies, regardless of nuanced affiliations.</p><p>However, the sensitivity to ownership and location persists, especially as Europe faces talent and capital challenges relative to the US. Some fear these cross-border moves may reflect a talent or capital drain rather than a purely strategic expansion. For VCs, these moves prompt critical questions about where returns and impact are truly centered, especially for funds with a Europe-first mandate.</p><p>Lomax emphasized that what truly matters is where these companies are innovating, hiring, and driving meaningful economic contributions rather than where their headquarters is listed.

Here, our data is objective internet traffic for hundreds of startups and scale-ups in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) technology. Internet traffic gives us non-arbitrary, transparent and robust data points we can use to estimate various trends in AEC-Technology and Construction-Tech, eg. how widespread demand, mindshare and even brand is for venture categories and specific companies in AEC-Tech.</p><p>We hope the community takes the ideas, builds on them, makes them better. We ignore arbitrary 'best-of' lists and 'market maps' propagated by venture pundits.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Risers of the Month</strong></h3><p><em>As a monthly summary, the following charts

AEC-Tech Internet Index includes AEC-Tech startups and scale-ups across the globe from North America, Asia (exc. China), Oceania, Europe, Africa and Latin America. founded in 2010 or after, who raised at least a publicly-known total of $25 Million in equity funding. and who did not exit or deadpool before 2019. The Index excludes ventures that are predominantly prop-tech, building operations or logistics-only, or those that have a massive share of their online traffic/visits through an app (instead of website). If the venture is direct-to-consumer (D2C) in AEC, it must show service-components to be considered in scope - eg. Houzz is not in scope for this reason.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: The primary data source for the AEC-Tech Internet Index is un-altered Semrush data. The data is updated monthly around the 10th day of each month. Semrush is widely regarded as accurate and reliable in web traffic analysis. While no web traffic analysis is perfectly correct - not even your own instance of Google Analytics - Semrush provides one of the most accurate estimates across the web.

countries and various fund sizes has revealed the following.</p><ul><li><p>Over two-thirds (71 per cent) of women planning on having children or more children were concerned about returning to work in venture capital, and one in five respondents (20 per cent) were very concerned.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Almost 80 per cent of respondents felt there was room for improvement in their return to work process, and just over one in three (38 per cent) said there was considerable room for improvement.</p></li><li><p>The top three concerns shared by respondents were career progression/promotion opportunities (32 per cent), the long-term sustainability of working in VC and parenting (25 per cent), and establishing boundaries, e.g., evening events (23 per cent).</p></li><li><p>84 per cent of respondents were concerned about parental leave (the amount of time off or the pay level).&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The venture capital industry remains male-dominated despite relatively rapid progress in recent decades. Women comprise 16 per cent of European General Partners, and women comprise only a third of investing teams. In the UK, there has been no change in the gender composition of teams since 2019, with female representation flat at 30 per cent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sophie Winwood, CEO of WVC:E, said: </strong></p><div class="pullquote"><p>“The findings in this report shine a light on the unique challenges women face in venture capital, especially when balancing motherhood with the demands of the industry. </p><p>Our goal is not to place blame but to foster understanding and inspire meaningful change. By sharing these experiences, we hope to offer valuable insights, spark important conversations, and drive action across the wider ecosystem — in workplaces, homes, and communities. </p><p>It's time to rethink how we support women and build an environment where they can thrive without choosing between career and family.”</p></div><p><strong>Ruth Foxe Blader, GP of Foxe Capital and Chair of WVC:E, said:</strong></p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Maternity and early childcare policy is critical infrastructure needed to rectify employment and pay inequity. But it’s totally taboo!&nbsp; </p><p>The social dimension is almost more important than the statutory. This report talks about it honestly and all of its complexity.”</p></div><p><strong>Check Warner, co-founding Partner Ada Ventures and co-founder of Diversity VC, said:</strong></p><div class="pullquote"><p>“The concerning stats in this report should be a wake-up call for the VC industry where parents, particularly women, have been massively let down. Unfortunately, the findings in this report chime with the stories of numerous women who have children when working in VC and have felt completely unsupported by the funds they work for. This is a big missed opportunity, as VC should be compatible with having a family. </p><p>If we as an industry don’t fix this, we will miss out on the best talent and, therefore, the best returns for investors.”&nbsp;</p></div><p>The report explores women’s concerns around parental leave and the differences between men's and women’s leave, returning to work and setting boundaries regarding policies and practices. It highlights some of these challenges' impacts and offers practical tips on navigating them. The report concludes with recommendations for partners, colleagues, General Partners and the community to improve the status quo for women, men and the industry overall.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png" width="1100" height="220" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2e93607-5191-4afb-b94b-51d0b094363e_1100x220.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Wanna be featured on eu.vc?

139	https://ventureunlocked.substack.com/p/private-market-investing-is-huge	Private Market investing is huge but still remains broken. 	When I co-founded Allocate in 2021, it was based on a 20 year observation that 1) Companies are staying private longer 2) Private markets started to become as important as the public market for investors (There are reportedly 108K software companies today but only 3% are public) and 3) Investors and GPs are still relying on outdated tools to deploy capital and to raise capital.	<html><head></head><body><p>When I co-founded Allocate in 2021, it was based on a 20 year observation that 1) Companies are staying private longer 2) Private markets started to become as important as the public market for investors (There are reportedly 108K software companies today but only 3% are public) and 3) Investors and GPs are still relying on outdated tools to deploy capital and to raise capital.</p><p>So despite the growth of the private markets, the increased fragmentation on both sides of the ecosystem (new manager entrants and the growth of high net investor interest) have created a system wrought with inefficiency and opacity. </p><p>Private market assets under management (AUM) have surged past $13 trillion, with projections to exceed $25 trillion by the decade's end. This is not suprising given the protracted time companies stay private (for tech companies &lt;4 years to 9 years+), the reduction of publicly traded companies, and historical return and diversification benefits of private markets. </p><p><strong>However, the current system does not support efficiency. </strong></p><p>Finding, performing due diligence, and accessing the right fund managers has become an exhaustive, time-consuming endeavor for LPs, amplified by the market's lack of transparency.</p><p>Beyond this, managing a private investment portfolio effectively is a significant challenge. Building a well-constructed portfolio, tracking investments and gaining key insights, and ensuring that new opportunities align with an investor’s evolving goals is nearly impossible without a structured, data-driven approach.</p><p>For most investors, this results in private market investing being more ad-hoc than programmatic, which often leads to performance that is not adequate to justify the illiquidity and risk of private market investing.</p><p>On the other side, fund managers face similar inefficiencies. They struggle to efficiently connect with the right limited partners, they often default to higher investment minimums that exclude a broad pool of potential investors and rely on outdated tools for LP reporting and communication.</p><p><strong>What IF this wasn’t the case?</strong></p><p>While I haven’t spoken as much publicly as I should have about what we are up to at Allocate, I have had so many people ask me what we actually do and don’t (note to self: do a better job on this).<br><br><strong>Here are a few TLDR points:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Allocate is not a fund of funds. While I respect so many of the great FoF managers, we are solving for something different through technology.</p></li><li><p>Private market investing has the potential to mirror public investing when it comes to access, portfolio transparency, and liquidity. </p></li><li><p>Artificial intelligence and data driven models will transform the private markets. </p></li><li><p>Private market investing in not a one size fits all. Tailoring and Personalization are the key in the future. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Allocate: Modernizing the private market experience<br></strong>At Allocate, we are continuing to build a lifecycle platform to bring this vision to life, with purpose-built software and data at the core.&nbsp;</p><p>While we started our journey by enabling responsible investing in opaque asset classes such as venture capital (and now Private Equity as well), we continue to believe that solving the private market pain points requires a focused software and data-first approach to provide the necessary tools for investors to efficiently achieve the best outcomes.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What does this mean?<br>For Investors:<br>Imagine:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Imagine </strong>discovering and analyzing highly personalized private investment opportunities that, powered by data and augmented by AI, recommend the opportunities that best account for your current portfolio and portfolio goals.<br></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank"

That is probably the last big problem.</em></p><p><em><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/training-data-eric-steinberger/">Eric Steinberger</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Even if we scale up inference time compute by the orders of magnitude Eric is implying, it’d still be much cheaper than human workers, as <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/enterprise-philosophy-and-the-first-wave-of-ai/">Ben Thompson pointed out</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>This second image is a potential problem in a Copilot paradigm: sure, a smarter model potentially makes your employees more productive, but those increases in productivity have to be balanced by both greater inference costs and more time spent waiting for the model (o1 is significantly slower than a model like 4o). However, the agent equation, where you are talking about replacing a worker, is dramatically different: there the cost umbrella is absolutely massive, because even the most expensive model is a <strong>lot cheaper, above-and-beyond the other benefits like always being available and being scalable in number</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>There’s some <a href="https://x.com/_philschmid/status/1842846050320544016">early evidence</a> that applying the right RL + CoT techniques can yield similar levels of performance from other frontier models that haven’t fully exploited inference time scaling, likely owing to some hidden chain of thought tokens. In any case, the other labs are undoubtedly investing these new scaling laws and repurposing their compute. </p><p>As the other labs collectively channel their resources towards inference time scaling, we’ll see use cases and capabilities flourish. The early high-ROI use cases of code generation and customer service will benefit from system 2 reasoning, becoming capable of replacing more experienced workers. Inference time scaling will also unlock novel system 2 functions like financial planning and analysis, corporate development, and strategy. </p><p>The most exciting conclusion is how multiple <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/10/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase/">app &lt;&gt; infrastructure cycles</a> are combining into an AI megacycle, just as previous technology waves were stacked on top of each other to create de novo products and experiences. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://blog.eladgil.com/p/megacycles-in-tech-crypto" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png" width="400" height="229" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:229,&quot;width&quot;:400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://blog.eladgil.com/p/megacycles-in-tech-crypto&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce20225-e41a-4aa0-9181-961629d99517_400x229.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Elad Gil</figcaption></figure></div><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://akashbajwa.substack.com/p/inference-time-scaling-laws?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://akashbajwa.substack.com/p/inference-time-scaling-laws?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://akashbajwa.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://akashbajwa.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://akashbajwa.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Software Synthesis&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://akashbajwa.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Software Synthesis</span></a></p><p><em>Thank you for reading.

It’s an exciting thing.</p><p>But there are a lot of reasons to be more strategic about your announcement, and a lot of factors you should consider to shape how, where, and when to announce it.</p><p>It’s a moment of organic gravity for your startup, product, and brand — don’t treat it as an afterthought.</p><p>When we raised our Series A from a16z we didn’t do everything perfectly with our announcement, but we did enough right to make it a trajectory-changing event for the company.</p><p>This week I’m breaking down:</p><ul><li><p>How to time your announcement</p></li><li><p>How to drive attention to your announcement</p></li><li><p>Where to announce</p></li><li><p>What to include</p></li><li><p>The most common mistake I see</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thefoundingjourney.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thefoundingjourney.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p>This is October’s ✨<strong> free </strong>✨ deep dive, and you can read the full post below. <a href="https://upgrade.foundingjourney.com">Become a member</a> to get a new one in full each week.</p><h2><strong>How to Announce Your Fundraise</strong></h2><h3><strong>Timing Your Announcement</strong></h3><p>You can set one of two primary goals for announcing a fundraise:</p><ol><li><p>Accelerate the business (user growth, partnerships, and/or hiring)</p></li><li><p>Kick off your <em>next</em> round</p></li></ol><p>If you nail the execution of your announcement then investors are going to reach out either way, so here’s a simple framework to decide what your primary goal should be:</p><p>Ask yourself two questions:</p><ol><li><p>How much does the business need to grow more before raising more capital?</p></li><li><p>Do you need to accelerate growth to hit those numbers?</p></li></ol><p>If you need substantial growth, and need to accelerate to hit it or don’t have your growth channels fully figured out yet then it’s a good idea to announce sooner rather than later and leverage the momentum you receive from the raise.</p><p>If either of those things are <em>not</em> true, then you’re likely better off holding the fundraise in your back pocket until you’re ready to raise again.</p><p>There are other practical reasons to wait, too.</p><p>For example, if you close your round in November or December you’re likely better off waiting to announce til February (everyone else will be announcing in January, which makes it noisy for fundraising announcements).</p><h3><strong>Driving Attention</strong></h3><p>Legacy media no longer has a monopoly on driving attention.</p><p>In fact, even tech publications sort of begrudgingly cover fundraises these days — if they do, it’s probably because the product fits some larger narrative they’re interested in.</p><p>The good news is you don’t need them, and you can nail your announcement solely with social media.</p><p>Here are some tips:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Announce in the morning →</strong> There are two reasons for this. First, when people log on throughout the day the content that will be at the top of their feed will be what the algo thinks they’ll be most likely to engage with, so getting engagement signals on your content before then increases the chances it will be shown. Second, after 12 hours or so your content will be relatively stale so you want those 12 hours to occur during the day, when most people are online. This is true no matter which social media platform you’re announcing on. The earlier, the better (I like 8:30am EST if you’re in the US, personally).</p></li><li><p><strong>Coordinate ahead of time → </strong>Send an email to your entire contact list the day before letting them know you have a big announcement going live the following day, at a specific time, in a specific place (platform and account). Explicitly ask them to comment and repost on the announcement. Then, send another message <em>with the post’s URL as a link</em> immediately after it goes live.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct all traffic to a single place →</strong> The way to maximize reach on social media is immediate, relevant engagement on your post. This tells the algo that the post is interesting and should be shown to more people. If your email includes a link to your LinkedIn post, X post, website’s blog announcement, TechCrunch article, etc… then you’re going to dilute the impact of each one and the combined impact of all of them will be far less than the impact of one would have been. The difference is huge. </p></li></ol><p>My creator partnership platform, <a href="https://megaphone.network">Megaphone</a>, can help with that last part btw. We let you get big creators involved and have helped tons of fundraising announcements at this point.</p><p>One founder even wrote me after their announcement saying it drove over 200 sales demos in the first couple hours.</p><h3><strong>Where to Announce</strong></h3><p>This one is simple:</p><p>Announce where it will have the biggest impact.</p><p>There are two factors:</p><ol><li><p>Where will you have the biggest megaphone (no pun intended)?</p></li><li><p>Where do the people you want to get in front of spend their time online?</p></li></ol><p>For example, if you’re optimizing for investor attention then you probably want to announce on X.</p><p>But if you have 10 followers on X and a million on TikTok, you might want to announce there instead.</p><p>You may also want to consider where you have the capability to create the most performant announcement post, but that’s secondary since you can always <a href="https://s665g04yp0s.typeform.com/to/rOXjvxHU">pay people to help create an engaging post</a>.</p><p>Your guiding principle here is that you want your announcement to enter the zeitgeist in some way. Figure out where you have the best shot of making that happen.</p><h3><strong>What to Include</strong></h3><p>There’s some basic info that every announcement should have:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How much you raised → </strong>Bigger looks better but including the number makes it real, no matter what it is.</p></li><li><p><strong>What round it is →</strong> This isn’t super important but does help people anchor their reaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Who invested → </strong>Lead with well known names, and don’t @ them — just write their names (it’s more recognizable and the tag won’t matter since you’re alerting them via email anyway).</p></li><li><p><strong>Your company’s name →</strong> You’d be surprised, I’ve seen people forget this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your one-liner →</strong> In a concise way, tell people what you actually do.</p></li><li><p><strong>More context →</strong> You likely have more to say that will fit in your one-liner. That’s ok. If you’re announcing on X just don’t pack it all into the first tweet — start a thread that’s well formatted for skimmability with generous whitespace.</p></li><li><p><strong>An image or video →</strong> People are visual, and posts with an image or video get a boost by the algo too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Somewhere to go → </strong>You want to drive this traffic somewhere. Ideally you can capture their emails.</p></li></ul><p>Not everyone has an AI video model to launch at the same time as their fundraise announcement, but I’m including this as an example of one of the better announcements I’ve seen in the last year:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank"
