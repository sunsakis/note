Many of us have been praying to a fake god for this moment in history. It’s here. Happy dance. Yay.</p><p>In the old economy, it was all about productivity.</p><ul><li><p>Hustle hard and work long hours</p></li><li><p>Use productivity apps</p></li><li><p>Attend lots of meetings</p></li><li><p>Consume endless amounts of information</p></li></ul><p>What’s changed is AI can now do hard work and meaningless admin at scale. Every day that passes, AI can do more of humans' bullsh*t work.</p><p>Fast forward two more years and humans won’t need to do many of the hard work activities we once did. It’s going to leave a strange void in the world. For once in humanity’s existence we’ll have a lot less to do.</p><p>Before you get excited, it doesn’t mean we’ll all be sitting on mobile recliners watching Netflix all day, as the animated movie Walle-E suggested. No.</p><p>What it means is productivity will no longer f*cking matter.</p><p>What will now matter is creativity.</p><p>Music, art, acting, painting, solving hard problems…. will go back to being the dominant forces that shape the world, the way they did during the Renaissance period hundreds of years ago.</p><p>To prepare for this creative revolution, you’ll need to master the art of unproductivity. Unlike productive habits, the ones that help you be more creative are uns*xy as hell.</p><p>Here are the new habits you’ll need to master.</p><h1>Walk like Socrates through nature as if it’s 350 BC</h1><p>The modern workday sucks because it doesn’t include walking.</p><p>You wake up in a box. Eat from a box. Commute in a box to an office cubicle. And maybe drink a cylinder of Coke for lunch to change things up.</p><p>When I started working for myself one thing that changed is I began to walk like a madman. I’d often turn meetings into walking meetings. I found not only did I feel better, but I was more creative. Walking in nature takes it a step further.</p><p>The greenery and fresh air help the mind unwind.</p><p>Dan Koe once said:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Ancient Romans and Greeks, Steve Jobs, Charles Darwin, and an ever-growing list of visionaries, strategists, and innovators attribute their success to surprisingly low work times accompanied by an abundance of restful activities like long walks.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The greats from the past didn’t work long hours, and going forward we won’t need to either. Walks are a perfect way to fill in the extra time, so when we are working we’re 10x more creative.</p><p>One thing that makes my walks more interesting is imagining that someone from 1000s of years ago walked the same steps that I’m walking right now. It lights a bonfire underneath my imagination and helps me come alive. Try it.</p><p>To unlock your creative superpower make sure to throw your headphones in a lake and walk in silence.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>I’m not saying going for a walk will solve all your problems, I’m just saying there’s no problem that’s going to be made worse by going for a walk – Ryan Holiday</p></div><h1>Daydream in the middle of the day</h1><p>I once sat in the lobby of the bank I worked at daydreaming.</p><p>The next day my boss told me that a “Head of” thought I was slacking off and not talking to enough customers. What that dumbass didn’t realize is, while daydreaming, I thought of a way to onboard more tech companies to our bank using a referral partner.</p><p>This breakthrough would never have happened if I spent 12 hours a day only talking to customers and yelling “buy our bank accounts, sir, they’re the best. We’ll make you rich.”</p><p><strong>New mental model:</strong></p><pre><code>If you learned something at work, it’s probably time to forget it or at least relearn it.</code></pre><p>There’s some sh*tty programming the corporate world infects you with – not being able to daydream is one example.</p><p>Another way to daydream is to go watch traffic on a freeway for 3 hours. The movement of the cars becomes like a free form of meditation. When we daydream we activate our imagination and escape the hell of our to-do list.</p><p>I find spending time with my 1 year old daughter helps too.</p><p>We’re always imagining new games to play, and pretending regular household items are strange characters. The other day my daughter told me the broom was actually a horse that escaped from the enchanted forest. I’ll roll with that. Sounds plausible. The brush does kind of look like a horse’s mane if you think about it.</p><p>What turns an adult back into a baby is a lack of imagination.</p><p>(It’s the new pandem!c, by the way.)</p><p>You’re gonna need that old rusty imagination again if you want to survive the AI wars and still make money in this new economy. Start turning brooms into wild horses.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>The creativity part doesn’t happen without the daydreaming. In my line of work, I need to daydream – Lin-Manuel (creator of the Hamilton Musical)</p></div><h1>Write like Hemingway is your hero</h1><p>I shouldn’t admit this (and don’t tell my wife) but writing makes me h0rny.</p><p>Not in a s*xual way, but in a way where writing forces my brain to come alive and join the dots between ideas.</p><pre><code>I find I have ideas while I write – not the other way around.</code></pre><p>Writing is one of the best ways to be creative. Every artistic outlet can begin with writing.</p><ul><li><p>A movie starts as writing.</p></li><li><p>A painting starts as words on a page.</p></li><li><p>A podcast starts with an email pitch to a guest.</p></li><li><p>A Youtube video starts as a written script (yes, Youtube is mostly all scripted).</p></li></ul><p>Your life will get better if you write every day. The next level is to write and publish on social media. This allows your ideas to become magnets for opportunities and humans that can elevate those ideas beyond your inner world.</p><p>Groups gathering for the purpose of creativity are going to be crucial in the new economy. Let writing help you form the network needed.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking — Leslie Lamport</p></div><h1>Blow your ear drums out with this type of music</h1><p>Modern music sucks.</p><p>I used to be a DJ for 10 years. The rock of the 70s and 80s, or the pop of the 90s, or the house/dance music of the early 2000s is way better than the boring sh*t we have now from artists like Kendrik Lemar.</p><p>They put these stupid filters on their voice that make them sound like robots. I prefer to just listen to a human voice without all the robot sounds.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about music a lot lately.</p><ul><li><p>Is it that we’ve written every chord progression or melody in existence already and that’s why modern music sucks?</p></li><li><p>Is the technology making the music sound worse?</p></li><li><p>Is music not as exciting anymore in a dopamine-fuelled world where you can get bigger rushes of adrenaline from video games or p*rn?</p></li></ul><p>I’ve concluded it’s none of that. Music sucks because creativity is lacking.</p><p>We’re so busy working to cover the high cost of living that there’s not a lot of spare time to be creative.</p><p>Between news, politics, and social media our brains are fried. We’re trained to think the world is worse than it is, so after a while we don’t have the energy or optimism to sit down at a piano and make a beautiful piece of music inspired by a love affair.</p><p>We don’t even have as many love affairs anymore because going to a bar for a drink isn’t as convenient as texting a Tinder buddy (who soon, too, will be an AI bot). Why find love when you can make love to a s*x doll? Sounds odd, but that's where we’re heading.</p><p>The quality of music is a reflection of the quality of human consciousness.</p><p>We’re at rock bottom, especially right before the US election, but thankfully we’re on the cusp of good times and great classic hits again as creativity takes center stage once more.</p><p>To make better music and be more creative we still need music, though. I recommend movie soundtracks. Turn on a bit of Hans Zimmer during the day and watch it change your mood. You’ll feel inspired to create.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>If you listen to songs on your phone sorted by when you added them, you are essentially going back in time. Songs trigger memories, wonderfully so! – Ankur Warikoo</p></div><h1>Read and feel like you’re taking speed</h1><p>The gurus on Twitter/X say reading is procrastination in disguise.</p><p>They say you need to have a goal in mind before you read any book, like everything is a f*cking self-help concert starring Tony Robbins on lead guitar, Jim Rohn on the drums, and Zig Ziglar rapping. Screw those illiterate morons on X.</p><p>Reading is incredible. </p><p>On the surface it’s unproductive. Below the surface it’s the source of better ideas and an expanded vocabulary.</p><p>When your vocabulary expands you get better at explaining things. You become more articulate which makes you a better communicator. In a world of AI, you better hope your human communication skills are first-class.</p><p>The best way to choose a book to read is to follow your curiosity.</p><p>I double dare you to piss off the productivity gurus and read a fiction book. That’ll really get ‘em raging and seeing red! (haha evil Denning)</p><div class="pullquote"><p>To experience time travel, read. To achieve immortality, write – James Clear</p></div><h1>Practice forced solitude while smoking a fat corn cob pipe</h1><p>Loners are the new elites.</p><p>Being unproductive often means being alone. The need to be around others all the time is often why people work office jobs. They can’t stand not to have office friends. I don’t say this as an insult. Nope.</p><p>I worked in banking for 10 years longer than I should because I was lonely.</p><p>Seeing Greg the concierge or Amelia the cleaner was the highlight of my day. We’d talk smack about lots of stuff, even topics I had no clue about (like AFL football).</p><p>Disappearing to a wood cabin in a forest and smoking a corn cob pipe used to be the dream. Then people laughed at it. In this creative boom, it’s going to become the goal again.</p><p>Suburban life has downsides. Where I live it’s a chorus of dogs barking 24/7. I may be home alone as I write this, but it feels like I’ve got 101 Dalmatians sitting next to me.</p><p>Without true solitude it’s hard to think deeply. It’s hard to uncover those big ideas we have stuck inside our s*xy brains. Start escaping to the woods now as a habit, so you can develop this skill in time for the creative boom.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>It takes 4-6 weeks of uncomfortable isolation to create a new vision for yourself, and your life – Zach Pogrob</p></div><h1>Be quieter than normal</h1><p>The productivity age loves talking.</p><p>Go into a productive workplace and you’ll see endless meetings full of people talking over the top of each other. People just keep talking because they want to feel like they’re #AddingValue or coming across as smart to their colleagues.</p><p>True creative people are quieter than two ants having s*x.</p><p>Record producer Rick Rubin is one such example. The dude has a long beard and is famous for being quiet in front of the world’s biggest musicians. Or take actor Keanu Reeves (who I’m convinced is Jesus reincarnated).</p><p>The guy does these big-ass interviews and spends much of the time taking long pauses and looking up at the ceiling. I’ve found quiet people have smaller egos. This makes them more creative because our ego often stands in the way of our best ideas.</p><p>Listen more than you talk. Try saying nothing for the next 24 hours.</p><blockquote><p>Quiet people have the loudest minds – Stephen Hawking</p></blockquote><h1>Final Thought</h1><p>The mind is your biggest asset. Without taking care of it, you’ll never be creative enough to thrive in the digital renaissance of the 2020s.</p><p>Get used to feeling like you’re pissing your time down the toilet. Being unproductive is how you’ll increase your creativity, so you can outperform AI and carve a path in life that’ll lead you to personal freedom.</p><p>Tell me which of these unproductive ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S. Are you writing online?&nbsp;</p><p>If so, how's it going?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://forms.gle/52b4ZFkQCDLXdfQF7">Take my gut-check survey here.</a></p></body></html>	Productivity cult fades as AI takes over mundane tasks. Creativity becomes key. Embrace unproductivity: walk in nature, daydream, write daily, listen to inspiring music, read widely, seek solitude, and practice quietness.	2024-09-26 11:04:39	2024-10-05 19:39:39.567	2024-10-10 14:04:45.042	{english}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26f73617-4fc7-4d55-94ac-9ec4b01edd92_999x869.jpeg	Tim Denning	you-must-master-the-art-of-unproductivity-if-you-want-to-be-successful-in-the-new-economy

Their big Lambo exhaust pipes, massive rubber wheels, gold chains, Rolex, and cheeky grins. There’s a photo of me somewhere on the internet bent over the front of a Lambo as if it’s mine.</p><p>The dream was to start an IT company. That’s what every dude did in the early 2000s to get rich. Or invent a phone app. Now in a world of AI we can generate these digital assets for a few dollars.</p><p>I’ve learned what’s better than being a millionaire, though, is having F*ck You (F U) money. It’s a life-changing concept that’ll change how you work, live, and earn/spend money.</p><h1>People want this more than money</h1><p>The path to big cash seems smart.</p><p>You go from being a postcode povo to working your butt off and eventually making enough cash to live large in a mansion.</p><p>Except this isn’t the dream.</p><p>I’ve achieved the goal of F U money and so have many of my closest friends. People don’t really want loads of money, even though at the start they genuinely feel they do.</p><p>What they secretly want below the surface is free time.</p><p>This is a paradox though. The way to get more free time is to buy it with money. So unless you figure out how to make more money and increase your leverage, you’ll always be dreaming of little Cinderella fairies with $100 bills while sniffing the invisible coke of an unreachable dream.</p><p>So… how you think about money is crucial to unlocking F U money.</p><h1>F U money is about having zero luxury possessions</h1><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Yep. Buying luxury seems stupid when you have the ultimate prize of unlimited free time. I met a woman yesterday. She works at Apple. She lives in Melbourne near me but in a nicer postcode.</p><p>She was telling me how she bought this awesome BMW, and how they just went on a family trip in it. It was so comfortable and nice to drive, she said.</p><blockquote><p>Me: “That BMW must have cost a lot.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Her: “Well, not really. It’s on a novated lease, so I pay $3000 a month for it.”</p></blockquote><p>She then asked me what car I drive. I told her about my Honda Civic that turned 9 years old a few days ago. She didn’t get it.</p><blockquote><p>“Why the heck would you drive that piece of crap when you don’t need to?”</p></blockquote><p>She didn’t understand F U money, which is fine. Not here to judge anyone. We don’t know what we don’t know. There’s no MBA in F U money (maybe I’ll create it).</p><p>We dug a little deeper. She told me how she used to have a great boss at Apple. Then they quit and now the new boss is an ass. He made her last two bonuses go to zero.</p><p>She still has her high salary, but in Australia she knows not too many other employers will pay her that much.</p><p>At 50 years old she’s terrified of layoffs or being fired by the new boss. Then we circle back to me. Why do I drive the Honda Civic? Because when I had the high salary I didn’t waste money on bullsh*t luxuries that took me further away from F U money.</p><p>I was happy to drive the Civic and look poor so that now I can be wealthy and free. The trouble is once I got F U money, I couldn’t talk myself out of driving a crap car or living in an average house.</p><ul><li><p>Needing luxury is a band-aid people buy when they’re not free.</p></li><li><p>Luxury is stupid to people who have F U money.</p></li></ul><p>F U money is a mindset. It’s not just getting more money, it’s not needing so much money.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can't fathom” – Naval Ravikant</p></div><h1>You no longer care about titles or status</h1><p>In startup wank land people get h0rny over self-appointed titles they give themselves like founder or entrepreneur.</p><p>In corporate wank land it’s all about the “Head of Nothing” or “Chief Pleb Officer” titles. I used to froth over these.</p><p>Getting an email from a Chief felt like losing my virginity. The feeling would wear off in seconds and I’d be right back to boredom and uncreative work. I later became a title titty, in love with sucking up to whoever the new, big job title was on the block.</p><p>Things have changed.</p><p>According to the title titties I’m currently a founder, CEO, or entrepreneur. But I don’t use any of these labels. My email signature is blank. I sign off with the word “Tim.” I have no real company logo. I just don’t f*cking care about titles anymore.</p><p>You could be The President Of The United States and I still don’t care.</p><p>Nobody tells me what to do, and I can leave my computer at any time and piss the day away eating banana sundaes if I want. Can ya do that at Amazon, bro? Nope. That’s what F U money does. It makes you immune to titles and status.</p><p>Here’s the simple path to F U money:</p><h1>1. People need to know who the f*ck you are and what you stand for</h1><p>Ghosts don’t get sh*t.</p><p>A ghost is the typical human. They have a resume which is full of a bunch of nice stuff they say about themselves. They then bribe a bunch of people they barely know who they worked with to be references and back up the lies on their resume.</p><p>If you google them nothing comes up. They say stupid phrases like “trust me” when you ask about their capability.</p><p>They can tell you about a lot of stuff they’ve done, but what they don’t tell you is these achievements were divided unevenly across 50 different people. So trying to find out what they really did is impossible.</p><p>There’s a level above this. They’re the personal brand romantics. They are great at holding selfie poles in front of their big noses and reciting Mark Twain quotes until they get drunk from all the likes and go flog themselves off in a corner.</p><p>The path to F U money is simpler. You don’t need any of that.</p><p>What you need is a riot act. A go-to-war mission statement that builds a movement. Some sort of online presence that isn’t all about you and your finger bang g-string line that launched last Friday at 3 AM for a limited time only.</p><p>The gurus will tell you to get 1M followers. I’d suggest you target 5000-10,000 followers and convert them into a newsletter faster than Usain Bolt.</p><p>Remember: if I don’t know you and you have no social proof, then I don’t trust you and I sure as hell aren’t giving you an opportunity that helps you reach the milestone of F U money.</p><p>Takeaway: build a small movement using social media.</p><h1>2. Upgrade from business virgin to at least this level</h1><p>Few weeks ago a person committed fraud against me.</p><p>They said they’ve worked in sales for 30 years working for this iconic Silicon Valley tech company. Part of the reason they got pissed off at me is they claimed I “upsold them” via email.</p><p>According to his 30 years in sales, upselling is unethical. People only buy one product then never want anything ever again, even though he fan-girls over Microsoft Office which upsells people on the daily (because Microsoft Word can’t fix every problem a person encounters in their life/business).</p><p>Obviously I disagreed with him (side note: they were later found guilty of fraud).</p><p>I call people like this business virgins.</p><p>Someone else’s logo did the selling for him. John, you were an order taker, mofo. There’s little to no skill involved when the sales and marketing are done for you. You’re just the whip cream on top of the sundae. People are buying whether you’re there or not. Wait until all that is gone. Then we’ll see what you’re made of, chief.</p><p>When you become an owner your understanding of business and the financial markets is massively upgraded. You go from a 5th grader understanding of business and money to a billionaire on a yachts understanding of money.</p><p>Not because you’re smarter, but because being an owner forces you to take off the adult-size nappy and sh*t yourself every day for a few years.</p><p>If you’re not an owner you’ll never have F U money.</p><p>A job is modern slavery. Start there but don’t end there, amigo.</p><h1>3. Invest like the best (not what you think)</h1><p>F U money sounds like a sales pitch for “buy real estate” or “invest in the S&amp;P 500 and you’ll be a rich b*tch at 95 when you can’t piss by yourself anymore.”</p><p>But the finance bros are wrong.</p><p>The best investment you can ever make is in yourself. What you don’t know is stopping you from the things that’ll make you enough money to permanently forget about money.</p><div class="pullquote"><pre><code><em>"It costs less to learn how to make $100,000 per year than it does to not know how to make $100,000 per year." </em>– Alex Hormozi</code></pre></div><p>In the last 30 days I’ve spent $30,000+ on education – courses, masterminds, 1-1 coaching, group coaching, etc.</p><p>I never used to do this. I was a tight-arse. But that’s why I couldn’t figure out the online game. I’m a 7-figure creator. If I want to become an 8-figure creator, I need to learn from and spend time with 8-figure creators.</p><p>An 8-figure creator isn’t gonna let me “pick their brain” over a raspberry milkshake because I’ve got gorgeous dimples and a 1/4 of a 6-pack. So I’ve learned to spend money to get around the people and ideas that’ll take me to the next level.</p><p>A few weeks in a mastermind can make me more money than 40 years investing in the S&amp;P 500 can. Ohh… and self-education for owners is usually tax deductible. As a result, I now have an unlimited self-education budget.</p><p>(There’s one caveat with this approach which is it assumes you learn from people with social-proof who are practitioners. Obviously, if you invest in stupid sh*t sold by grifters and wannabes who teach people to make $50 per article on Medium dot com, well, you’re heading straight for the welfare line.)</p><p>Once your self-education is taken care of the next step is to reinvest in the business that is you. Maybe you’re a solopreneur or an entrepreneur with a few employees by this point. Nice one.</p><p>Instead of taking money out of a business it’s better to reinvest in your business. </p><p>Because, once again, a business will make more money than copying Grandpa Warren Buffet’s investing strategy from last century.</p><p>The last stage of the funnel is investing in financial assets - stocks, gold, crypto, real estate, etc. This is the cherry on top and requires a basic financial education.</p><p>The point of financial assets, that most people don’t get, is they’re a way for you to store your wealth and protect against that wealth being stolen in the form of inflation. Said another way, financial assets store your time and prevent leaks.</p><p>Takeaway: income is always #1 priority, storage of wealth is #2.</p><h1>4. Blow up your brain &amp; go mildly insane</h1><ul><li><p>No more consumerism – discounts, specials, coupons.</p></li><li><p>No more politics/news – Fox, elections, CNN, Donald Duck.</p></li><li><p>No more losers – toxic people, complainers, blamers, people who always feel oppressed or worship the idea they’re a minority.</p></li><li><p>No more imposter syndrome – social proof wipes out the “I’m not an expert or “I’m not qualified.” These feelings are implanted deep in our brains from years ago, so we’ll justify paying $100K for a degree and maybe being silly enough to buy another one as a mature adult.</p></li></ul><p>Bottom line: No more fear.</p><p>Your brain helps navigate you towards F U money. If it’s messed up and distracted by all the stuff in the world you alone can't solve, it ain’t gonna help. Nothing is gonna happen. You’ll do what most people do and stand still screaming “I’m busy!”</p><p>Society needs us to feel busy so we’ll forget our freedom dream that leads to F U money. If you find yourself saying <em>I’m busy,</em> you’re already not free.</p><p>The solution is to prioritize freedom by pursuing this simple path to F U money. You now have the core steps. Go do it. Get free.</p><p>Tell me whether you agree with the idea of F U money and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

He told me to add “employable skills,” get plenty of certificates for different stuff like an MBA, and always build my career network.</p><p>Staying employable became a mantra that motivated me. I always felt if I lost my focus on being employable, my career would end, and I’d plunge into darkness and poverty.</p><p>A few weeks ago I got a punch in the guts. A former banker I used to work with said:</p><blockquote><pre><code>“Tim, there’s no nice way to say this but you’re now unemployable. You can never go back to banking. You’ve crossed to the other side. What if your online thing doesn’t work?”</code></pre></blockquote><p>I realized in that moment they were right. I will never be employed again.</p><h1>What it bizarrely means to be unemployable (see if you can relate)</h1><p>To understand the reality of being unemployable, we first need to look at the other side of the spectrum.</p><p>Writer Sean Cheo explains the current business environment better than I can:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Corporate hiring is broken.</em></p><p><em>AI-drafted job specs with unrealistic expectations, ATS (Application Tracking System) filters, 6+ rounds of interviews, 25 hour ‘practical tests’, rampant ghosting... all for a chance to get a low-ball offer then laid off within a year because the CEO wants another 8% annual pay bump.</em></p><p><em>I find it absolutely insane that right now it's easier to make money off crypto, the stock market and self-employment in that order than it is to land a full-time job.</em></p><p><em>And this seems to be consistent across age groups. The young get rejected for lack of experience, the old for ageism, all while the same vacancy gets refreshed every few weeks.</em>”</p></blockquote><p>Being employable <em><strong>used</strong></em> to be the American Dream.</p><p>Now it’s the American nightmare. I’d rather go to hell than join the current circus that is corporate and the business world. It’s a joke.</p><p>Last week I stopped working with a long-term client. They told me they’re now too busy to work with me. I went back through the notes. When we first met he was working 9-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.</p><p>Now he’s working 16-hour days and all weekend. So he’s right, he is too busy. What he can’t see is the transition into this death spiral. Last year he was a froggy sitting in warm water. This year he’s a froggy sitting in almost boiling water.</p><p>I said this: “How far can this go?”</p><p>It’s 16 hours a day now. Does he break at 18 hours a day? 19 hours? To top it off, he told me he has two kids. So yes he’s damn busy and can’t work with me anymore, but at the same time he is unable to see his kids again until retirement.</p><p>He’s 55 and will retire at 65, so that’s 10 more years without a family.</p><p>Yet I’m the weirdo for working with him to build a Plan B. He’s too busy for me. If he leaves his 16 hour a day job, he immediately can’t pay his bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the problem?</p><p>The corporate world gradually turns up the heat until your f*cking face is on fire and you can’t leave without getting your genitalia caught in a guillotine and going home bleeding while not being able to ever piss again.</p><p>I’m already teaching my 1 year old daughter to say “Go F yourself” to university and anyone selling 9-5 jobs.</p><p>So, yes, I’m unemployable, but it’s obvious being employable is way worse.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg" width="600" height="479" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:479,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92859,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b029b0b-f8ab-4efc-9f6a-856d08312f20_600x479.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Image Credit-Midjourney</em></figcaption></figure></div><h1>The subtle shift in the working world</h1><p>There’s more to the story…</p><blockquote><p><em>I find it absolutely insane that right now it's easier to make money off self-employment than it is to land a full-time job – Sean Cheo (edited)</em></p></blockquote><p>Writer Hildy Harker notices something similar:</p><blockquote><p><em>I’m more frequently seeing people hired as contractors.</em></p></blockquote><p>In my academy I’m seeing this same trend. Solopreneurship, contracting, freelancing, consulting, and coaching are exploding like never before. In my last 9-5 job ever, at a bank, about 50% of the 40,000 people they employed were what they call flexi-workers (I was a consultant employed by a consulting firm.)</p><p>The trend of full-time employees is slowly dying. Why…</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Once you taste the money of working for yourself you automatically become unemployable” – Wyld Tribe</p></div><p>It’s not just the money either. It’s the freedom.</p><p>Screw commuting hours every day to sit on a chair in front of a computer when you could do the same from home. It used to make sense pre-2020. Now it just seems crazy to a rational person.</p><p>With the right skills you can serve multiple employers at a time.</p><p>In my last consulting gig, I consulted to several banks simultaneously. What I did for one bank I could do for another. Business isn’t that complicated. You can copy and paste your skills to any corporation. You can serve an Aussie client today, and an Indian one tomorrow.</p><p>Expect the trend of solo business owners to continue.</p><h1>Here’s how to become unemployable so you can experience personal freedom</h1><p>A few ideas to get your mind cranking and your heart pumping.</p><h3>1. Believe in ownership</h3><p>As an employee you’re a renter with a landlord.</p><p>At any moment you can be evicted thanks to the magic of layoff culture. To become unemployable like me you must understand ownership and the benefits. The biggest takeaway of ownership for me is how tax works.</p><ul><li><p>As an employee your tax is taken out before you get paid.</p></li><li><p>As an owner you get paid in full then decide when, how much, and how you want to pay tax.</p></li></ul><p>This gap in the matrix has doubled, if not tripled, my personal net worth (legally).</p><p>If you like being told what to do and having zero ownership, stay employable. But without ownership you’ll never be wealthy and you’ll always be told what to do.</p><h3>2. Reject corporate nonsense</h3><p>Politics is a hell hole.</p><p>The 2024 U.S. election is painful to endure. It took me a decade to realize working for a corporation is no different. The workplace is full of politics by default. There is no promotion or career ascension without playing politics.</p><p>That means you have to act fake, mislead people, and play each other off as if you’re a character in the movie Hunger Games.</p><p>Only once I left corporate did I realize how stupid it was.</p><p>Sitting in back-to-back meetings. Wearing a penguin suit every day. Saying the right thing. Pretending to care about a war in Europe. Wearing a badge on my suit jacket for whatever random special day of the year it was.</p><p>When I visit my 1 year old daughter’s daycare, honestly, it reminds me of the workplace. In fact her daycare is more civilized than any workplace I’ve seen. A workplace has lunch breaks, lockers for bags, a desk to sit at, teachers to tell you what to do, and story time aka town halls.</p><p>I don’t want to work in an adult daycare ever again. Perhaps you can relate.</p><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> until you hate corporate culture you won’t leave. Get real about it. Do you really love it?</p><h3>3. Become unreasonable enough to think you must be paid more</h3><p>If you think you’re paid fairly you’ll never leave.</p><p>I used to think $700 a week with $100 leftover at the end was great. Then I got one client outside of my bank job that paid me $200 for a 1-hour video call. It bent my reality. In the open market online you can get paid a lot more.</p><p>The point of a corporation is to make a profit. That means they need to pay employees the least amount possible to maximize their profits. So the incentives of a job literally work against your personal goals. Yet 99% don’t realize.</p><p>Your income could probably double if not triple what it is now. That’s a huge knife to the chest for some.</p><p>Don’t quit a job. Experiment outside of your job to prove it to yourself (then send me a commission of $1000 and let’s call it even…joking not joking).</p><h3>4. Make money online and don't be a skeptical pleb</h3><p>Skeptical people don’t make it in life.</p><p>They also can’t become unemployable. There’s a level of optimism and open-mindedness needed to transition away from being employable.</p><p>Almost 5 years ago I partnered with a stranger named Todd. We did an experiment together. It worked. So we did another one. Then we became business partners.</p><p>I live in Australia. He lives in Tennessee. He has all my passwords. I know the code to his cupboard full of naughty books from an adult shop (Jane Austen novels).</p><p>Todd and I have never met. Read that again.</p><p>Maybe he’s 4-foot or a drug dealer or smokes meth. No clue. Don’t care. I didn’t trust him. Nope, I validated through proof of work.</p><p>If I was a skeptical pleb that outcome would never have happened. It requires some level of trust. Contrast that with a reader I met last week who was petrified to put their credit card number into a website for a $50 newsletter purchase.</p><p>The internet isn’t a scam. Neither is AI or crypto.</p><p>These systems run the Earth, and you either understand and take advantage of them, or get replaced by them.</p><p>The way to defeat skepticism is to try some stuff. Take some small, calculated risks. Cap your downside so that if one risk, a $50 newsletter, blows up in your face, you don’t go bankrupt and end up living in a gutter eating beans and rice.</p><p>Have you ever felt unemployable? What was your strategy?</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S.

The worst humans on the planet are people who’ve never failed. They lie to us. They pretend to have a go. But they never do.</p><p>They refuse to fail which is a hate crime against humanity. If we don’t fail, humanity doesn’t progress. That’s a sin. It makes you a disgrace. My bizarre hack for figuring out if I can trust someone is to find out if they’ve ever failed.</p><p>Here’s a radically different way to think about failure so you can make your big goals a reality.</p><h1>The most dangerous person you’ll ever meet</h1><p>A few months back, a person committed fraud against me.</p><p>They paid for a coaching service that I delivered. The coaching call was recorded, and at the end, they kept saying how much the coaching helped. I left the meeting with a big smile. This is my legacy. This is why I quit my banking career forever.</p><p>A few weeks later, I got a notification saying this customer was accusing me of never delivering the service. I contacted them and went back and forth via email.</p><p>I was shocked to learn they were willing to lie and commit fraud against me, so they could avoid ever starting their business. Their problem wasn’t me, it was failure.</p><p>That’s right, they were willing to commit a crime to avoid the chance of failure.</p><p>I met another person through writing online who was similar. They’d got themselves into a sticky situation. Because of a divorce and a loss of job, they’d likely lose everything. To avoid the failure they took their own life. It broke my heart.</p><p>People who aren’t willing to fail will do crazy, murderous acts.</p><h1>It all starts with a tiny error in thinking</h1><p>We don’t come out of our mommy’s womb being failure-resistant. It’s a learned skill.</p><p>Avoidance of failure starts with not taking any risks. You won’t invest money in yourself. You won’t buy a $100 course. You won’t invest in financial assets like stocks. You won’t change jobs or ask for a leadership role.</p><p>And in my world, you won’t risk writing about your ideas and publishing them on social media (even under a nickname).</p><p>On the surface this seems like a small problem. But if you spend enough years not taking risks, your personal growth plateaus.</p><p>Then when the normal curveballs in life strike – sickness, loss of a loved one, redundancy – you’re up sh*t creek without a paddle holding a basket of g-strings and praying to a god you don’t believe in.</p><p>Not taking risks is a red flag.</p><p>Test: when was the last time you took a calculated risk?</p><p>The answer better not be “last year, mate” … or you’re screwed harder than my ex-banker colleague who slept with 100 partners in 365 days to prove a point to “tha boiz.” (Side note: I think he also got herpes.)</p><blockquote><p><em>“The danger of inaction outweighs the risk of error” – Justin Welsh</em></p></blockquote><h1>The life-changing truth about failure that’s not obvious</h1><p>Ready?</p><p>If you fail nobody gives a sh*t.

They’re too busy with their own. They’re too busy with workplace attendance, KPIs and keeping their slavedriver boss happy. Their phone fills up whatever other free attention they have left over.</p><p>So if nobody’s watching then who cares if you fail? Jesus? Tim Denning? Nope. Absolutely nobody cares. Now you’re free bird…fly high as a kite.</p><h1>The best part of failure is easily overlooked</h1><p>Stories are the driving force of humanity.</p><p>We all know that. Stories are what create famous people and produce movies that win Oscars. The common part of all good stories is failure. If a person is born into a billionaire family, starts a business, and buys a Bentley you don’t care. No one’s making a movie about that, right?</p><p>But if this same person was born poor, had to overcome struggles and failed many times, every Hollywood heavyweight wants to make the movie.</p><p>The more failures the more successful the movie.</p><p>The best things I’ve ever done ended in failure. They make for the best stories. They’re why people bother to read anything I’ve written.</p><p>If I didn’t…</p><ul><li><p>Smoke the joint at 16 and pass out</p></li><li><p>See my best friend drown in a river</p></li><li><p>Start a $50M/year business that I walked away from</p></li><li><p>Go through an eating disorder</p></li><li><p>Suffer extreme mental illness</p></li><li><p>Go on over 100 dates looking for love and get rejected</p></li><li><p>Get left in the middle of the road by an ex-girlfriend</p></li><li><p>Lose my job in 2019 because of a dictator boss</p></li><li><p>Fail to return to banking</p></li><li><p>Lose $1.2M due to theft</p></li></ul><p>… you’d never be reading this Substack. That’s the truth.</p><p>The failures make you magnetic. They make you human. They make you trustworthy. They make you seem worth knowing.</p><pre><code>Failures help you generate your own wisdom.</code></pre><p>When you don’t fail you learn jack sh*t. You stay stuck in overthinking, procrastination, ma$trubation, and perfectionism. The road to hell is paved with a lack of failure.</p><p>Ever met a know-it-all? They’re the ones that don’t fail. And they throw peanuts at people like me who have failed.</p><p>“See, look at what Denning did wrong. He’s a crook I tell ya.”</p><p>The only criminals are those who’ve never failed and refuse to fail at anything so they can keep their big fat ego intact and pretend to be superhuman.</p><p>Instagram bikini babe influencers flying in private jets aren’t the liars. Nope. It’s the failure virgins.</p><h1>“We shouldn’t glorify failure p*rn” – critics</h1><p>Yes we should.</p><p>You should want to fail. You should expect to fail. Most things you try in life won’t work the first time. That’s the whole point. Trying one time is a disaster. You try the same thing multiple times and iterate slightly each time. That’s how you figure out what does work.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“It is a curse to have everything go right on your first attempt” – Robert Greene</p></div><p>I treat life like a series of science experiments, even though I failed the subject (thanks to Professor Tweddle D*ck in high school).</p><p>No one knows what works.</p><p>Guessing doesn’t work. Neither does hoping, praying or relying on luck. And waiting to be chosen by gatekeepers definitely doesn’t work.</p><p>The only way to figure stuff the hell out is to 100% expect to fail.</p><p>Yet this goes counter to conventional wisdom. 99% of people aren’t willing to fail. They’re proactively trying to avoid failure at all costs. That’s why average people like me can succeed because there’s little to no competition.</p><p>What a time to be alive. Soak it up. Enjoy the view. Risk failing in all your glory because nobody gives a sh*t if you do.</p><h1>The question from Tony Robbins that changed my life forever</h1><p>Tony the tall mofo (god bless him) shook my world up when he challenged a group of us to answer this question:</p><p>What’s the worst that can happen?</p><p>The challenge is to get scary with it. Imagine your worst nightmare. Get creative. Picture all the doomsday scenarios. Imagine Orange Man Trump gets elected and a nuclear bomb goes off all in the same day. Times it by ten. Do a strip dance in Times Square. Stab yourself a few times with a steak knife to add some bloody effects.</p><p>Now…. what’s the worst that happens?</p><p>Not much.</p><p>You wake up the next day and try again, except this time you have some failures to tell you what NOT to do.</p><p>When I lost $1.2M in a day it felt like I was being cremated alive in a funeral parlour in front of my unborn daughter.</p><p>The money was gone but the way I made it wasn’t. I knew how to do it again. So I did. This time I made the money back 10x faster because I had the shortcuts already.</p><p>Whatever the nightmare scenario is, it’s a lie. Comebacks are always possible. They’re the default. And from the place of rock bottom you have the free motivation and drive to go faster than everyone else.</p><p>This is gonna sound whack, but I hope you fail with whatever goal you’re working on right now. I really want you to get this gift from heaven.</p><h1>Closing Thought</h1><p>Never trust people who refuse to fail.</p><p>If you’re currently someone who’s immune to failure, it’s time to stop being a criminal and change. There’s no way to get what you want without failure.</p><p>The myth of overnight success lied to you. America’s Got Talent isn’t going to give you a golden buzzer and make all your dreams come true (just look at the 99.99999999% of talent that never made it on any TV talent show).</p><p>The good news is you’re only one failure away from figuring out what does work, so you can finally live a life of freedom most will never be able to imagine. The barrier to entry is taking risks. The bar is extremely low.</p><p>Tell me which of these failure ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

It’s unrealistic to go from a regular salary to $0 and build some business, movement, or not-for-profit based on hope.</p><p>The way I built my own thing was using the first 2 hours of the day in a different way to most people. Change how you use the first 2 hours of the day, transform your life.</p><h1>Building out of desperation leads to disaster</h1><p>When I say build your own thing, I’m talking about building something online.</p><p>A social media audience, online business, movement, paid community, newsletter, blog, network, etc – the options are endless.</p><p>To master this goal you first need to ensure you don’t make the #1 mistake: building out of desperation. A guy I met, James, illustrates this perfectly. He wanted to build an empire online around mindfulness.</p><blockquote><p>“I have $1000 left to my name &amp; need to have this make money in the next 30 days.”</p></blockquote><p>As a result he was looking for shortcuts, tricks, and to buy followers. He even considered spamming people with his mindfulness course. The week after I met him he was putting links to his programs all over other writers’ Substack post comments.</p><p>This is what desperation does. It makes you weak. It makes you look cheap. And that’ll repel people the way bug spray murders spiders.</p><p>What works better is to make sure you have your main income locked down first, then you build your online empire.</p><h1>The day is won or lost in the morning</h1><p>It’s common to leave building your own thing until the end of the day. This is when your energy is the lowest and you’re least disciplined.</p><p>The temptation to trade the 2 hours you have to build your freedom machine for some Netflix or drinks with friends is too high, even for a David Goggins navy seal-type.</p><p>What’s worse is those who plan to build their own thing on weekends or holidays. And the ultimate failure is to build your own thing when you’re retired (may as well set the dream on fire right now).</p><p>What you can control is today.</p><p>The first 2 hours of every day are an opportunity most will piss all over. I famously remember one guy my friend Ayo spoke to who said they had no time to build anything. They handed over their daily schedule. It included an hour for eating breakfast and 2 hours of housework in the morning.</p><pre><code>If you bullsh*t yourself, no one can help you.</code></pre><p>We can find 2 hours to build if we understand how important it is. The way I do that is to consider the alternative…</p><h1>Defy what the system told you</h1><p>Parents, university, bosses, employers, friends and/or cultural norms in your country likely all told you to follow a predictable path.</p><p>These predictable paths create the societal system that enslaves most people without them realizing it.</p><p>My friend Niha is a woman from India. She quit her consulting career to work 3 hours a day as an online writer. Her family thinks she’s nuts. Her former colleagues barely speak to her. Not even her husband gets it.</p><p>She said to me:</p><blockquote><p>“Women aren’t this bold in my culture. They have a place. They go to university, get a job their parents approve of, then get married to someone who’s chosen for them and start popping out kids.”</p></blockquote><p>She wanted more out of life so she said no.</p><p>If you don’t build for the first 2 hours, what you have is the nightmare of the predictable path that a lot of people are trying to escape and don’t know how.</p><p>You don’t escape prison in a moment’s notice. Watch the TV show Prison Break. You build an escape plan then slowly test it until you make your calculated escape.</p><p>The way we deal with the downsides of a conventional life society wants to have is to eat sugar, drink alcohol, drown in distractions, and to endlessly entertain ourselves to death with Netflix and superhero movies.</p><p>There’s a better way of life.</p><h1>Go all in like a mofo</h1><p>Ideas are like a**holes, everyone has them.</p><p>The only way this first 2 hours of every day plan works is if you commit. Scrap that. It only works if you go all in like a mofo.</p><p>Lukewarm plans are easy to override. Full-on commitment is harder to back out of, especially if you tell others who will hold you accountable.</p><p>I always built my own thing while working a job. It’s only when the 2020 layoffs were in full swing that I ramped up my efforts. I went from working on my thing when I could to blocking off whole mornings.</p><p>I had no expectations. The mornings I did it were lonely. Complete solitude. It was just me and the sound of birds outside my apartment window.</p><p><strong>It’s hard to describe it.</strong> They were some of the best days of my life. Some of my clearest writing came out of me.</p><p>People close to me knew I wasn’t f*cking around. In a way, it made them quietly proud of me. They saw I was growing from a child living in an adult’s body into a man who lived up to his values and couldn’t be controlled by anyone or anything.</p><p>The 2 hours a day were hard to get in.</p><p>My work email was always overflowing. I got so ruthless toward the end of this journey that I started to show up for my day job later and later. It used to be 8 AM, then 9, then 10, then right at the end I was clocking in at 11 AM.</p><p>Checking out of a job so I could check into my real goal felt incredible.</p><h1>It starts with releasing your ideas</h1><p>Ideas stay trapped in our heads.</p><p>The pressure to release those ideas builds up like a toilet with a turd clogging it up. To get some relief, we start to get fantasies of writing a book.</p><p>We tell ourselves we’ll put our ideas in there. We may take some notes over time. We may even write some chapters of the book.</p><p><em>But the book never comes out.</em></p><p>Finally, we retire at 65 and write the book. Then we publish it on Amazon and nobody reads it. Now we think our ideas weren’t that good and it ends in what I call last-leg-of-life depression. Feelings we could have been more, as well as deep regrets.</p><p>We continue to grow old, then join the long queue for the cemetery and wait our turn. All that potential then turns to dirt and the worms munch on your remains.</p><p>The simple solution isn’t to let ideas clog up our minds.</p><p>Part of building your own thing is to release your ideas into the online world through social media.</p><ul><li><p>These ideas become the foundation for whatever you want to build.</p></li><li><p>They also help you attract the people who can help you build, and for whom you’re building something for.</p></li></ul><p>This daily release of ideas stops fantasies of writing books from destroying your life.</p><h1>Listen to your curiosity. Pay attention to your true desires.</h1><p>Humans are great at settling.</p><p>We hide our true desires and convince ourselves an office job or by-the-hour manual labor work is our calling. It’s not. To build something of your own you have to dare to follow your curiosity.</p><p>My 1 year old daughter is growing up fast. I can’t wait to tell her that her dad is Alice from the book “Alice In Wonderland.” I spend entire days falling down rabbit holes and not coming up for air. I let my curiosity go absolutely wild.</p><p>It’s fun as hell.</p><p>Some days that leads me to become the mad hatter from the story, too. But inside madness and chaos is our ability to transcend ourselves. Our curiosity is the map to our true desires that we so eloquently bury and let die when we become adults.</p><p>Curiosity is the path back to happiness.</p><h1>How to win the first 2 hours of every day</h1><p>Let’s get practical.</p><h3>1. Wake up earlier</h3><p>If you have a job or kids, then some parts of the day aren’t flexible. I had the same problem. The only solution is to wake up earlier.</p><p>It sounds crazy the first time you think of it. But if you can wake up earlier for a week you’ll realize it’s 100% possible. You either find the time or let excuses like “I have kids dontcha know” hold you back.</p><p>I don’t give a sh*t if you think your life is special. It’s not. Make it happen or watch others make it happen. Own or be owned. Choice is yours.</p><h3>2. Try removing the warm-up routine</h3><p>The song and dance with morning routines is ridiculous.</p><p>One way to build in the first 2 hours of the day is to remove the warm-up. No morning routine. No “I’ll start after my coffee.” No “I’ll read my emails first.” Nope. Just do the hardest step and start. Get straight into it and watch how fast you get momentum.</p><h3>3. Start the night before</h3><p>Every night I used to write down what I wanted to do in my 2 hours of power the following morning. I still do this today.</p><p>Looking at a blank screen is a nightmare. We have things we want to build and there are steps to take to make it happen. Some pre-planning works wonders so you can just wake up and start.</p><p>Start your morning the night before.</p><h3>4. Leave this devil device out of sight</h3><p>The devil doesn’t wear Prada. The devil is your phone.</p><p>This distraction machine will guarantee you don’t have 2 hours in the morning. Easy solution is to leave your phone out of sight. No Whatsapp/Telegram. No emails. No phone calls or checking the weather or seeing what meetings you have.</p><p>That last one is key. When I used to be foolish enough to sometimes look at what meetings I had for the day first thing, the anxiety would start to build. I’d get so anxious I couldn’t build anything in the first 2 hours of the day.</p><p>It was 10x worse for me because I used to suffer from anxiety. It used to make my hands shake all day, give me runny poos, and exclude me from social events. It ultimately ended in the collapse of my successful eCommerce business.</p><p>The best work is done in a calm, relaxed state. Remove the phone and anxiety from the early morning, and you’ll build better.</p><h3>5. Giggle like Pamela Anderson and have fun</h3><p>The joker in Batman was right: “Why so serious?”</p><p>That’s why I hate modern adult life and working for corporations. It’s all too serious. The point of building your own thing for 2 hours every day is to come alive and have fun. It’s to experience the pure joy of creation. It’s to make up your own rules.</p><p>Make sure what you’re building is fun.</p><h1>Closing Thought</h1><p>The good life starts with one small step.</p><p>Building your own thing for the first 2 hours of every day is the best logical step you can take right now. I freaking dare you to give it a go and see what happens.</p><p>Tell me what you want to build (or are building) and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S.

They “#tried” instead of obsess like a maniac and make it happen by being high agency.</p><p>Passion is disgusting, it’s criminal.</p><p>Writer Zach Pogrob has a going-to-war <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-vgdXwJZec/">mantra</a> he suggests people who want to be successful should follow. I’m going to dissect every detail for you.</p><h1>Daily routines need war</h1><p>What’s misunderstood about true success is it sits on the knife’s edge of calmness, focus, present-moment awareness … and chaos, fury, anger, frustration, and rejection.</p><p>I’ve chased this path for 10 years and it’s nearly broken me multiple times. But in those moments my mindset shifted and I became someone new.</p><p>The world is never at peace.</p><p>We’re always on the edge of nuclear war. Some small war in Europe or the Middle East could easily blow up into World War 3. We need this chaos to have the relatively peaceful times we’ve seen in the world since World War 2.</p><pre><code>Nature doesn’t function in calmness.</code></pre><p>We need the snakes to kill the rats and bite the humans. We need the floods to clear the land and drown people to make room for new life.</p><p>Wanting life to be calm is a fatal human error.</p><p>Every day you’re meant to fight a war of some kind. If you’re not you’re leaving your potential on the table. You’re drowning in piss-weak self-care and work-life balance that will slowly poison your dreams and goals.</p><p>If your habits are cookie-cutter and without chaos, you’re probably on the path to mediocrity, sorry to say.</p><p>Add war.</p><h1>Schedule discomfort</h1><p>If your life feels good you’re probably one step away from rock bottom. Or complete and utter meaningless that’ll bore you to tears. Success and discomfort go together like a Big Mac and fries.</p><p>Wake up early. Like, I dare you to wake up at 4 AM and witness the beauty. I dare you to go to the gym at 7 AM on a Saturday like I did last week. It’s in these moments you realize there’s zero competition.</p><p>People hate discomfort. Their loss is your opportunity.</p><p>You don’t need to be better. No. Just different.</p><p><em>Different</em> could be embracing discomfort. Or doing an intense workout every day for a year. Or spending more time on your goals than feels healthy or #normal. Or missing every social function for the next 90 days.

I was sleepwalking through life like a zombie. I had no real reason to grow or change. Life’s incentives were stacked against me.</p><p>The worst that could happen was I’d get laid off. But that came with a 6-figure payout and 90 days before I’d be out the door.</p><p>So the motivation to evolve was still zero.</p><p>When I left and started my own business I witnessed terrifying chaos. No day is the same. There’s no guaranteed income. One day I could get hacked. The next day I could be banned from LinkedIn.

I’d bought myself a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CbxWDHzPVsF/?img_index=2">second hand jeep and a couple of dog boxes</a>. As I headed off to get my very first dog, <a href="https://www.happydoggo.com/dog-stories/mr-fox">Mr Fox</a>, I was nervous and only had crazy dreams in my head. </p><p>What I do remember is how hard it was for 6-8 months I was doing them alone. I wanted to feel the pain, understand the problems and catch the dogs myself. I got bitten 3 times and crawled under many shacks and ran up hills and into rivers after dogs. I only managed to do 302 sterilisations in those first 8 months as I had to drive 2 per day to the vets myself. </p><p>That experience was absolutely crucial in forming my understanding of how hard it is but also how important this was for the dogs. In my local area I could see the small difference it was making. It was a lightbulb moment in my head. This was how you improved not just a few dozens lives but 1000s.</p><p>After those 8 months I decided to make a huge change. I would focus on raising money and awareness with <a href="https://www.happydoggo.com/">Happy Doggo</a> to accelerate sterilising both on Koh Samui and around the world. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png" width="1198" height="752" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:752,&quot;width&quot;:1198,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2086098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664d4f28-8544-4fb9-87f6-bb479b871344_1198x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>A Huge Team Effort With Our Partners </h3><p>What I very quickly realised from sterilising the dogs myself was that it would be impossible to fix this problem alone. It is incredibly hard to catch dogs, interact with the community, get them operated on and return them safely. </p><p>We needed partners. We have two brilliant ones with <a href="https://robsdogs.net.au/">RDF</a> here on the island and <a href="https://www.soidog.org/">Soi Dog</a> nationally. We figured out the quickest way to get things done was to fund them both at scale and turbo charge the sterilising. </p><p>Seeing the Happy Doggo logo beside another charity and team work happening in the space to collectively help the dogs never gets old for me. You can do a little bit on your own but together as part of a team we can all achieve so much more. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png" width="1256" height="592" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:1256,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1644530,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63f587eb-af61-423a-8f21-eab04f549e87_1256x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>100% Coverage Is Impossible</h3><p>We can never get to all dogs sterilised in any given area for a number of reasons including…</p><ul><li><p>Some locals won’t allow their dogs to be done </p></li><li><p>Dog breeders who want to make money from puppies</p></li><li><p>Dogs being brought in by migrant workers</p></li></ul><p>By getting to 90-95% though it means the number of dogs suffering is decreasing massively.

Back In those days I could feel very worthless and life had little meaning. </p><p>Finding the dogs changed everything. I now wake up every morning and while looking in the mirror ask myself the question “if you died tomorrow is this what you want to be doing” and the answer is always overwhelmingly a yes. Nothing is more important than helping these dogs. </p><p>I remember clearly the feeling of fear heading out in that jeep wondering what on earth I was doing and how it seemed impossible to fix an entire island. But here we are. Koh Samui is done.</p><p>I now have the same fear about being able to fix all of Thailand or changing South East Asia as whole. At the back of my head I’m terrified that I have repeatedly said we would do this across the entire world. It seems absolutely impossible as a target but so did fixing a small island not so long ago. </p><p>Sometimes the numbers are easy to gloss over and comprehend their scale. I like to think of Tina when I’m looking at the spreadsheets and big numbers. In my mind its not just 6000 dogs but rather 6000 Tina’s we are funding to sterilise every month. That makes it very real in terms of grasping the enormity of it all. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp" width="790" height="494" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:790,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:54086,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf4b1d3-8219-4bf1-9957-e9877bf37a71_790x494.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>None of this would be possible without people supporting online or on the ground with the dogs.

The occasion was the launch of <em>Blotter</em>—an illustrated book by countercultural scholar Erik Davis that charts the under-reported history of LSD blotter art. Blotters, in case you’re wondering, are highly-absorbent pieces of square paper that liquid acid is dropped on, and they are usually decorated with pop cultural iconography like flying saucers, cartoon characters, and other tongue-in-cheek or trippy images. The audience at the event did not disappoint: as I sat at the bar drinking Diet Cokes, an animated hippie sidled up and whispered RFK conspiracies in my ear. In the crowd, I spotted long-haired bikers in leather jackets covered in Grateful Dead pins, and at least one shirt that spelled out ERGOT in Greek letters.&nbsp;</p><p>Then the lights darkened and Davis took the stage in front of flashing images of the most iconic acid blotters ever made. By the late 70s, blotter had become the dominant method for distributing LSD, he explained. While their designs are easily written off as a form of illicit branding, Davis makes the case that this “ephemeral and snackable” medium amounts to more than just underground commercialism; rather, he writes, they are “material manifestations of a visionary and irascible subculture whose potent iconography demand(s) to be preserved.”&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png" width="840" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:882416,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d3af52d-d27f-4bdc-902e-a54f511c5f40_840x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mark McCloud at the Institute of Illegal Images (Photo <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/institute-of-illegal-images-lsd-art-16615568.php">via SF Gate</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Blotter </em>collects its material from a multitude of sources, including original interviews with (typically press-shy) LSD blotter-makers, as well as reports from the Drug Enforcement Agency, which ironically provide historically valuable and sometimes obsessive notes on which designs were showing up on the streets. Mostly, however, <em>Blotter </em>draws from the collection of Mark McCloud—a swashbuckling renegade who Davis met through the Bay Area psychedelic scene, and who has been collecting the world’s most beautiful and rarified acid blotters at his San Francisco museum, the Institute of Illegal Images.&nbsp;</p><p>McCloud eventually got up on stage next to Davis, his knuckles covered in gold rings. While Davis has the vibe of an elfish professor, McCloud’s eyes had the mischievous twinkle of a psychedelic pirate who has spent years battling the authorities that tried several times to arrest him and confiscate his collection. Later, Davis told me this book, more than any other he’s written, was infused with a sort of love: McCloud obsession with blotter art, Davis’ fondness for LSD, as well as their friendship with each other.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg" width="1200" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:253362,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F027e627f-c13e-4887-8472-eb7e3fe8348c_1200x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">McCloud’s skull ring and pen were so swag I had to grab a pic of it… </figcaption></figure></div><p>I recently caught up with Davis, who was chilling in Northern California’s dankest county, Mendocino. We discussed some of the the coolest, wildest, and most next-level blotters ever made—<a href="https://ravenewworld.substack.com/p/8-lsd-blotters-that-defined-psychedelic">check them out here</a>. Below is our extended interview, which gets deeper into this idea of acid blotters as a form of countercultural <em>media</em>—as well as strange tales of chemists praying over LSD crystals and other deep lysergic lore. </p><p><strong>Michelle: Let’s start with this idea that acid is kind of a new </strong><em><strong>technology </strong></em><strong>that comes about in the early 70s.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Erik: One of the motivations for the book was to grapple with the particular and peculiar nature of LSD. Even though many of our narratives of the counterculture derived from the 1960s, there’s still a weird way in which we haven't really digested or reframed what that compound is.&nbsp;</p><p>LSD emerged in the West immediately in and after World War II. A whole set of new technologies, from television to radar, emerged from the craziness and absolute horror of WWII. LSD is part of that mix. When it shows up, it comes on as very contemporary and looks like technology, psychiatric medicine, and media, rather than an ancient expression of the gods drawn from plants. MK Ultra also happened to latch onto LSD, as it did many other drugs, so it’s carrying so many different ghosts, some of them really disturbing. That partly characterizes why it's such a weird and singular psychedelic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Acid has a lot of cultural baggage with a very fraught history within the counterculture. Is this book an attempt to situate it in a different way for our contemporary moment?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lot of people prefer plants with indigenous histories that don't seem so tainted. I was talking with a younger person who said they stayed away from LSD because it was associated with mind control! So yeah, I did want to turn around the story about LSD. Psychedelics are like spirits—they have a quality of animation, but they're not exactly alive. And the stories we tell about drugs help shape our experiences of them—they’re part of the set and setting.&nbsp;</p><p>LSD has literally worn all these images on its skin—and those images don’t really work like a logo or a brand. LSD is more like a one-page comic book, except it’s really tiny. It is an anomalous form of print media that has a relationship to other media, like psychedelic poster art. The book doesn’t talk about the experiences of LSD that much. It offers a different perspective than “this person did this, and here’s Timothy Leary, and here’s the Grateful Dead.” Those people are off to the side, because the hero is the printed matter itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I'm really glad you didn't get too much into the phenomenology of LSD, because there's nothing more boring than reading about someone’s trip! And it’s cool that you compare LSD to comic books, punk zines, and other forms of countercultural media. Is that why you call acid a “meta-media”?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You can put LSD on a piece of blotter paper, but you can put it on a capsule, a pill, matchsticks, a Pez… you can put it on anything. In legal discourse, you call these carrier mediums. If you have, for example, a gram of crystal LSD in powder form, you can put it on blotter paper or pills, which have different weights. A lot of the time, someone was sentenced based on the weight of the carrier medium. Which is why mid-range and even low-level LSD dealers got screwed.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is, blotter images are totally superfluous in this calculation. You don’t need it. The medium is a blotter paper, and everything on there is like a meta-medium—a bonus, an overtone, a vector, a reference, a joke, a wink, a sign of belonging. So I'm using that term “meta-medium” in a playful way.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg" width="1000" height="1003" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1003,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1542658,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4ea9dd1-46fc-4960-b2a7-569c6b8e031b_1000x1003.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">One of the notable acid tabs in Blotter</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>In the book, you write about how these images go beyond just putting your logo on something. Do you think there’s something about the acid blotter that transcends, or maybe elides, straightforward commercialism?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Obviously there's a major commercial element, and people do make a lot of money off of acid, but it's a very, very different trade than other drugs. It's mostly carried out semi-independently of other drug trafficking, and it doesn't involve a lot of big gangs. I'm not trying to overly romanticize it, but it has a different market logic. Another thing is, it doesn't really work as a brand for very long, because brands are very consistent. It's the same Advil I've looked at for 20 years. With acid blotters, if they become well-known, somebody can just copy them—there’s no intellectual property law.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, you're in the realm of the copy. We're going to replicate all these molecules, print multiple copies of the same image, soak them in LSD, and distribute them. So while we still might think about it in terms of branding, it has a different kind of logic than what we mean by brands or trademarks.</p><p><strong>I learned a lot from this book. You have this really interesting story about how Nick Sand and Tim Scully [makers of Orange Sunshine, possibly the most famous batch of LSD ever made] put the same batch of acid on different colored tabs, and a lore grew on the streets that the different colors had different effects. But in fact, it was all the same LSD. I feel like this happens so often today, where people attribute specific attributes to certain blotters of acid, as if they were like different weed strains.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is the problem of the copy. Is the copy always the same? If you keep xeroxing it over and over again, it starts to change. If you get into the more esoteric issue, it’s like, what makes different batches of LSD different from one another? Some people are like, sorry, man, it's just LSD. It's a molecule, so you can make it more clean or less clean, and it might have stuff in it with psychoactive effects that affects the quality. But a lot of other people are going to be like, there's something mysterious about what makes a batch of LSD particularly good. And then you get into the mystical side, where people like Owsley and Sand would sing songs and do prayers over the LSD crystals. They wanted to be fully present for this material transformation that would launch hundreds of thousands of people’s experiences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yeah, this is where acid culture really converges with New Age woo-woo. But when it comes to that kind of magical thinking, I do actually buy the idea that the art on the blotter is part of set and setting, and that our mindsets can be shifted by the images we look at before tripping.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Well, if I'm at a ritual, and I'm going to drink ayahuasca out of a styrofoam coffee cup versus a beautiful carved chalice with a dragon on it, that's a different experience. It’s a way to go, OK, this medicine is entering into me now, through this portal, this vehicle, this expression, this ritual. Well, the same thing applies to the images on the blotter paper. So you're right, this is a more concrete place where we see the magic of iconography operating as a kind of hint, flavor, perfume, or almost like a spell—because they have that kind of shift.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The legality around acid is really severe, and that is part of why the acid trade is so secretive. At least in my reporting, I’ve found it so hard to access the higher levels of the acid supply chain. But you have some really amazing stories of blotter makers and other people near the top. How did you access these stories?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hats off to Mark McCloud. A lot of the material is based on stories, experiences, and personal contacts that Mark has had over the decades since he started to collect the blotters, and eventually becoming a blotter-maker himself in the 1990s. He had a decade of underground work that allowed him to meet many people, and he also collected some written interviews in his archive.&nbsp;</p><p>So the stories in the book are pretty close to the horse's mouth, and that's part of what makes it lore. We also were able to interview some people directly who he knew, and therefore we could approach. Sometimes they said yes, other times they said get the hell away from me. But you need somebody who’s no longer doing it, and who’s at the edge of the blackmarket. They’re also going to be cagey about a lot of details.&nbsp;</p><p>One advantage of this book is that I wasn’t talking about the manufacturing or upper-level distribution of acid, except in general terms. As you say, there’s a lot of obfuscation in the LSD world for very good reason: it's been largely successful, with a few exceptions. Major LSD lab busts have been extremely rare for 70 years. But a lot of blotter-makers were quasi-independent, so they only made the blotter. Sometimes they laid it out, but oftentimes somebody else would take it and deal with it. So they were separate enough that some were happy to tell their tale.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:234883,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af2d7ef-22ba-49e9-9304-1b23fd16e600_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mark McCloud and Erik Davis signing books at the Berkeley Alembic (Photo via Erik Davis) </figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>I caught a whiff of McCloud’s flavor at the book launch, but I’d love to hear more about what a character he is.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This project came out of the fact that I had a friendship with Mark that went back to the early 2000s, when we met on the scene. In a lot of ways, of all the projects I've done, this was the one that was most about love, because it was about his love of LSD and my love of LSD, and it was also about our friendship. He's one of my best friends.</p><p>I always just really enjoyed his combination of good humor, full of stories, doesn't take himself seriously, has a pirate edge of raw intensity. He’s also a big character who knows everybody. So when I asked him to do this, he already trusted me. Trust is the singular value of this underground. It’s almost a real religious value, not in a negative sense, but in the sense that, inside of the criminal LSD underground, ratting on people is much worse than in our normie life, that kind of betrayal. Mark has a very high ethical standard, and he's quite a gentleman, even though he's a rascal.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing about him is that he has certain ways of telling stories where there's layers of indirection. So you have to hang around a lot. I had to go over and over and over the same stories to crystallize history out of a raconteur’s lore, and that required a lot of patience. I&nbsp;learned early on not to smoke the weed.</p><p><strong>Yeah, only smoke after the interview!&nbsp;</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>📝 TRIP REPORTS </h2><p><em>I’ve started reporting on psychedelic news for DoubleBlind magazine as their newly-appointed Culture Editor!

According to the brand’s creative director, their packaging designs aim to look “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91194573/overdrive-harm-reduction-test-strips">native to party culture</a>,” which I guess means that they look like cigarettes? I’m not sure how to feel about test strips getting co-opted into a form of lifestyle branding, but I also had a feeling this would happen back when I wrote about “Suck Dick Carry Narcan”<a href="https://ravenewworld.substack.com/p/suck-dick-carry-narcan"> for The Guardian</a> back in 2021!

And it’s really just a piece of clip art that the designer got from the internet. It’s based on Albert Hoffman’s famous bicycle ride after he first synthesized LSD. The designer worked at Paradiso club in Amsterdam in the 70s, and made a lot of their posters. One of the things you might not notice is that the numbers are silk screened on top of an offset printed image, which are usually not combined. He did that to make it harder to copy. And he added glitter to some of the numbers too, so people couldn’t just steal the design.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also just a great image of acid. I just love that sense of movement and dynamism of the bike. It seems very appropriate for LSD’s sense of movement and dynamism, and the modernity of it.” </p><h4>2. ‘Japanese Crests (reissue),’ original by Bernard Hassall (mid 1980s) </h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg" width="1000" height="999" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:999,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1322428,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170bc411-539b-45ac-9e06-2fe3c40ed90d_1000x999.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“This was a mid-1980s reissue of an earlier sheet of acid, known on the street as “samurais” and based in <em>Monsho: Family Crests for Symbolic Design</em> by Isao Honda. They were made by Bernard Hassall, who was friends with Terence McKenna and was busted. He was particularly artistic in his approach to making blotter, and the originals were a series of Japanese seals protected by a shiny black cover. These sheets came in a box, and one had a higher dose than the others. That one was touched in gold so the user would recognize the difference. The manufacturer, Leonard Picard, did a number of high-quality issues in the 80s and this was one of them.” </p><h4>3. ‘Camouflage’ by Sarah Matzar (mid-1980s) </h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg" width="1000" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2349917,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab2acdcf-014f-4d27-932b-0c50f337d32e_1000x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“This one is by Sarah Matzar, a woman who was involved in an LSD family in the Grateful Dead scene that was one of the core upper-crust crews.

This is one of her designs, and she also wove quilts, so one of their code names for acid blotter was “quilts.” I like the fact that it’s abstract, and that’s it’s pink.

Šiandien su jumis norėčiau pakalbėti apie tiesą. Ar jūs kaip rašytojas esate melavęs?</strong>Man tiesa yra labai svarbu ir aš niekada nemeluoju savo tekstuose. Tikiuosi, abu suprantame, kad jaunystėje klaidų buvo. Nesu išvaizdus. Tekdavo per rašymą sekso užsitarnauti. Kai rašai, kad gautum sekso, tai ne melas, tai gyvenimo pagražinimas. </p><p>Aišku, būdavo tokių merginų, kurios sakydavo, kad aš joms melavau. Mano meilės, eilėraštis išspausdintas laikraštyje be konkretaus vardo, juk tinka visoms. Ir Mildai, ir Danutei, ir Vitai, ir Monikai, ir dar daug kitų moterų. Negi Indrei sakydamas, kad eilėraštis skirtas jai, turiu visas kitas išvardinti? </p><p><strong>Taip, manau, logiška būtų.<br></strong>Ir man atrodo logiška, kad kai Indrė mane apjuodina ir vadina manipuliatoriumi aš turiu teisę jai atsikirsti. </p><p><strong>Bet ji, skirtingai nei jūs, nerašė apie jus straipsnio. Tik pasipasakojo artimiems draugams.</strong></p><p>Čia tik smulkmenos. Aš, kaip rašytojas, negaliu atsikirsti faktais. Faktus palieku mokslui. Man moka, kad aš fantazuočiau. Nuo kada fantazija yra melas? Galų gale, nuo venerinių ligų niekas nėra apsaugotas, tik todėl, kad Indrė pirmoji sugalvojo pasitikrinti nereiškia, kad aš ją ir užkrėčiau. </p><p><strong>Šiaip gydytojai gali nustatyti ligos platintoją.<br></strong>Ko tu prie tų ligų užsiciklinai? Žinoma, būna kartais, kad ir dabar koks nekaltas melas išsprūsta. Praeitą savaitę Anykščių lajų take vieną medį apgraužė bebras. Negi taip ir rašysi, ypač kai portalo redaktorius užsišikęs, reikia kelti skaitomumą. Parašiau “Anykščių savivaldybei nerūpi žmonių saugumas”. Medis gali nuvirsti? Gali? Gali prispausti žmogų? Gali.  </p><p><strong>Bet savivaldybėje dirba Indrės dabartinis vyras.<br></strong>Ir kas? Visi žino, kad aš buvau su Indre ir, kad ten dirba tas jos vyras. Jeigu nebūčiau parašęs, žmonės galvotų, kad žodžio laisvė neegzistuoja arba, kad aš esu bailys.</p><p>Mano profesijoje dar labai svarbu pagarba. Ypač reklamos užsakovams. </p><p><strong>Gal galite pabaigti tą su savivaldybe?<br></strong>Jau baigiau. Turėjau vieną incidentą, kai  mane apkaltino, kad melavau dėl lošimų. Nemelavau, o nutylėjau. Kalbėdamas su savo seneliu nutyliu, kad netikiu į Dievą. Tai ne melas, tai senelio širdelės apsauga. Senelis vis dar duoda man pinigų, lažybų bendrovės irgi. Neimdamas iš senelio pinigų irgi jį skaudinčiau. Šeimos vertybes reikia nešti į viešumą. Kodėl turiu skirstyti pagarbą? Mūsų pasaulyje ir taip per mažai pagarbos vieni kitiems.</p><p>Va, artėja rinkimai. Atrodo perpjaus vieni kitiems gerkles. Parašiau, kad Algis sutvarkė kanalizaciją Rėvos kaime. Kai supuolė visi ant manęs kaip vanagai. </p><p><strong>Bet Algis yra Indrės vyro konkurentas? O kanalizacija visoje Lietuvoje planinis remontas pagal Europos Sąjungos programą.<br></strong>Koks skirtumas, kad kanalizacija iš Europos Sąjungos. Dėkoti Europos Sąjungai tas pats, kas dėkoti – dangui. Geram rašymui reikia konkretumo. Jeigu nors vienas žmogus padėkos kitam, čia jau pliusas.</p><p>Be to, mano skaitytojai, netikrina nei faktų, nei informacijos šaltinių. Juk sutinkame, kad tokie žmonės turi teisę egzistuoti? Tai kodėl rašytojai, maitinantys tokius žmones, yra blogiečiai? <br>Aš nesuprantu iš kur tas noras rašytojus versti laikytis sugalvotų standartų, netinkančių niekur kitur. Pažiūrėčiau kiek ilgai išsilaikytų, pavyzdžiui, batų gamintojai jeigu gamintų tik savo dydžių batus. Va, mano koja kem penkta ir gaminu tik kem penkto dydžio batus. Nesąmonė.</p><p><strong>Bet juk rašytojai, žurnalistai turi turėti kažkokį moralinį stuburą. Vesti žmones pirmyn.<br></strong>Tai mes ir vedame žmones pirmyn. Juk tas projektas kur kartu rašėme.</p><p><strong>Čia dabar ne apie mus, o apie jus kalbame.<br></strong>Tai nežinau ar labai etiška į komandą pakviesti žmogų su negalia ir jam nemokėti, vien tam, kad gautume daugiau taškų pildydami paramos paraišką.</p><p><strong>Mes jam mokėjome!<br></strong>Tris kartus mažiau nei visiems kitiems.</p><p><strong>Darius būtų tiesiog namie sėdėjęs ir nieko negavęs. Mes gerą darbą padarėme.<br></strong>Be projekto tu pats būtum darbo biržoje sėdėjęs ir nelegaliai statybose dirbęs.</p><p><strong>Taip ir žinojau, kad su tais arogantiškais rašytojais net neverta kalbėtis.</strong></p><p></p><p>Šią savaitę galim susitikti Uršulės Toleikytės knygos <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1211789639941371">pristatyme trečiadienį:</a></p><div

I discovered a goldmine of micro life hacks on a Reddit thread called “Life Pro Tips,” that you can put into action without too much effort.</p><p>They’re awesome rule-of-thumbs that will save you time, money, and make you more sociable.</p><h1><strong>Say yes to more invites</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>As an adult if new friends invite you to something say, “Yes.” — Vanguard Anon</em></p></blockquote><p>Children get lots of opportunities to make new friends. </p><p>As adults they don’t come around as often. One of my good friends went through a brutal divorce last year. We tried to invite him to lots of social events. He rarely says yes and prefers to play computer games.</p><p>We keep inviting him anyway because occasionally he says yes. The last time he came with us he made a new friend. </p><p>That new friend has since started going on bike rides with him that has got him out of the house. We’ve noticed he’s losing weight, looking fresher, and in a better mood since.</p><p>Don’t underestimate the power of new friends. Say yes to random invitations and you’ll meet new, interesting people.</p><h1><strong>Think of everything you do as progress</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Sent someone a meme? You progressed your relationship. Drew a doodle? You progressed your art skill. Took a bath? You progressed your mental health.</em></p><p><em>Life is a bank and any time you do anything that brings you joy you’re earning.</em></p><p><em>— Mew Brew</em></p></blockquote><p>The reason why many of us have phases in life where we feel like we’re making no progress is because we make things too big in our heads.</p><p>Of course if your goal is to make 7-figures in a year you probably won’t achieve it. But you can sell one book for $20, even if it’s to your mother. Or you can send one sales email, even if nobody reads it.</p><p>It’s important to tell yourself after every small action that you’re making progress towards a goal. That self-talk helps give you self-fulfilling motivation — a type of motivation that will compound enormously over a year or more.</p><h1><strong>The weekend is where your future is built</strong></h1><blockquote><p>Use the weekend to build the life you want, instead of trying to escape the life you have — Bigger_ThanLife</p></blockquote><p>When I worked a job I hated, the weekend was my escape.</p><p>I did anything I could to numb the pain. The problem is it got me nowhere. I’d be right back to hell at 9 am on Monday morning. That’s when I learned to build after hours. We’re talking micro hacks, though, so hear me out.</p><p>Do 15 minutes of a new side project every weekend. Do it for 21 days to make it a habit. Every weekend add another 15 minutes. Within a few months you’ll slowly be transitioning from the life you hate to a new life with loads more possibilities. Quick transformations don’t work.</p><p>Slow transformations that start out as 15 minutes feel effortless. Effortless turns into action. Action changes your future.</p><h1><strong>Take pictures every day with your phone</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>You may not like being in pictures or taking them, but you will hate that you have no photos of some time period when you’re older.</em></p><p><em>Take pictures even if it is out of your comfort zone occasionally, for your future self — Squaragus_Asparagus</em></p></blockquote><p>I haven’t admitted this before so here goes… </p><p>In 2011, I went from 60 KGs to over 100 KGs in weight, thanks to a personal trainer. I thought muscles would help me attract women. It did the opposite.</p><p>When I tell people this story the first thing they ask is “can you show me a photo?” I didn’t take a lot of photos back then as I was in a deep, dark depression and hated myself. The idea of taking photos of myself felt stupid.</p><p>Now I regret it.</p><p>During the lockdowns caused by the global health crisis, I decided to make a change. I took multiple photos (even ones with masks) to remind myself of one of the most difficult times in human history. Now I have photos to show my future post-apocalypse children.</p><p>Photos are memories. Take plenty. Keep them off Instagram.</p><h1><strong>Be awesome to non-drinkers</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>If you offer someone an alcoholic drink and they say no, immediately tell them what non-alcoholic drinks you have. With no judgment.</em></p><p><em>They don’t owe you any explanation of recovery, medical contraindications, or whether or not they just don’t feel like it that day. — Lemjne</em></p></blockquote><p>I haven’t had an alcoholic drink for years.</p><p>Too many times alcohol has ruined my life.</p><p>So I stay away from it but it’s bloody hard. When I worked a regular job one of the hardest things was going to a social event and being asked “do you want beer or wine, mate?”</p><p>The truly awesome people would then follow up with “can I get you a soda or a sparkling mineral water?” The knob heads would keep asking why I didn’t drink. They’d accidentally embarrass me in front of an audience.</p><p>Explaining why you don’ drink is deeply personal.</p><p>I gave up due to a near-miss with cancer, my bad behavior around women when drunk, and the impulses to drink too much when life became unbearable. Explaining that in front of your boss or to a person on a first date with you is hard.</p><p>Quickly offer non-drinkers the non-alcoholic beverage options. They’ll love you for it and you’ll increase the chances of connecting with new people.</p><h1><strong>Ask this polite question in job interviews</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>From here on out, make “What was your company’s 2020 response?” a standard interview question. — PhasmaFelis</em></p></blockquote><p>Many companies did a terrible job in 2020 after the global health crisis. They treated us like bugs they could crush with their army boots.</p><p>How employers handle people during the tough times says a lot about them. If you’re deciding on a new employer and discover they did mass layoffs in March 2020, run a million miles away from them.</p><p>Compassion is the new business trend.</p><p>Every company that doesn’t get it will be scratching their heads and saying “why is it so hard to hire people?” Screw them.</p><p>They deserve it for being evil to humans.</p><h1><strong>Use this to avoid the death spiral into a useless conversation about politics</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Next time you are stuck in a conversation about politics, ask the person “what is your supported political party doing for you?” — Roboboy3000</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png" width="600" height="419" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:419,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8113bb6-e91a-4850-a936-70283f975945_600x419.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image Credit–Sara Tasker via <a href="https://twitter.com/meandorla/status/1325766630266298368?s=20">Twitter</a> (WARNING: image used for demonstration only and does not reflect my political beliefs)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Most political talk leads nowhere.</p><p>It turns into a character assassination based on emotions rather than facts. Our politicians are out of touch with reality. A large proportion of them are white males over 70. It’s no wonder we lack a diversity of thought. This will hopefully change, but for now, it’s a long road.</p><p>Vote when the time comes. Don’t get too caught up in it. Instead, work on yourself. No politician is going to save you from inflation, or bring down the cost of your bills, or help you get a job. That’s the harsh truth.</p><h1><strong>Pretend other drivers are your grandmother</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>When you don’t have all the facts, try to give people the most generous reason you can for their behavior.</em></p><p><em>Annoyingly slow driver? Maybe it’s a mom with a birthday cake in the back. This mindset will gradually make you less reactive, more compassionate and more forgiving of your own bad days.</em></p><p><em>— ContributionNarrow88</em></p></blockquote><p>I used to be a road rage maniac. I’d ride up the asses of every car on the freeway and scream “get out of my way, pal!”</p><p>That’s what deep anxiety sounds like.</p><p>In recent years I’ve used this life hack to think of other drivers as my grandmother. When she used to drive me around I’d be patient, forgive her when she made wrong turns, and be more helpful.</p><p>Grandma died a few years ago.</p><p>Her legacy lives on through the way I’ve decided to treat other drivers. All of the blowing up at drivers used to drain my energy. Now I’m just a Sunday driver in a lawn bowls outfit and candy pink visor hat, sharing the roads with my fellow grandmothers and grandfathers.</p><p>Takeaway: If you knew that annoying person had just left the hospital to farewell the love of their life after dying from cancer, would you be so cruel? Of course not. Try to think that way about everyone you meet.</p><h1><strong>Do the phone survey and unlock a hidden reward</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>If you’re asked to take a survey after a service rep/tech helps you out, take it and give them the best score possible— Stoncils</em></p></blockquote><p>I spent a good part of my career working in call centers. I had to ask every caller to do a survey.</p><p>Many of them would say no or hang up. It broke my heart.</p><p>They didn’t know how important it was. I had a KPI on how many surveys I got done. And if they left me a positive comment at the end it would get read out in team meetings.</p><p>One customer left me such a good comment after the survey that it got shared with thousands of my colleagues at a town hall meeting by our General Manager. As a result of that feedback I met my future boss who got me out of the call center and into a job I loved.</p><p>Customer service reps could do with your help. It takes 30 seconds and can help ensure they don’t have to work in the same job forever. Completing a survey is the gift of an opportunity.</p><p>You unlock the hidden reward of knowing you made a customer service rep’s day. Try it.</p><p><em>This final life hack is from me…</em></p><h1><strong>Don’t write controversial words on social media</strong></h1><p>It can get you banned and the platform’s machine learning/algorithms are trained to look for them.</p><p>You could be smacked in the face by the nanny police for trying to innocently share your story. They won’t tell you either. They’ll either block your content or shadow-ban you.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li><p>S*x</p></li><li><p>Coroni-rona</p></li><li><p>P*rn</p></li></ul><p>Instead, just substitute the controversial word for one that has the same meaning and won’t trigger the nannies. Here’s an example: “fuggit.” (Hat tilt to Sean Kernan.) See, you know what I’m saying, don’t you? Nice.</p><p>Until the web becomes decentralized this is what we have to deal with.

They refuse to take risks. They won’t consider a different point of view. They refuse to change. So their body ages but their “self” stays the same age.</p><p>It’s why there are a lot of children living in adult bodies.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons people lose in life comes down to how they use boredom. For some of us, we’ve accidentally learned to harness boredom. We don’t talk about it because a lot of us don’t even realize we do it.</p><p>Here’s a completely different perspective on boredom that’ll upgrade your life.</p><h1>Boredom is a luxury</h1><p>A friend of mine lives in Africa.</p><p>His family is poor. He’s lived through famines. He’s someone I admire. When I asked him about boredom he laughed.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Only rich kids complain about boredom. In my village we have enough work to keep us busy for a decade. No time for boredom or you’ll starve.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In one way he’s making a joke, but in another way he’s bang on.</p><p>Being bored shows a lack of gratitude. There are people battling cancer who’d love to have zero worries in the world and experience boredom.</p><h1>Consumerism needs you to be a bored ape</h1><p>Society isn’t trying to get rid of boredom.</p><p>Why? Corporations need you to be bored so they can sell you magic pills to cure it – entertainment, sports, video games, mindless apps, etc.</p><p>Boredom has an even darker side.</p><p>I grew up around many drug addicts. One pattern I noticed is they all say they used drugs to try and cure their boredom. They wanted a thrill because they were bored.</p><p>A sniff of coke gave them a high. It also ruined their life. When I think about my own bad habits, they always get the best of me if I get too bored.</p><p>Boredom isn’t scary, but how we try to cure it is. It’s a slippery slope that can lead to an unescapable hell if you’re not careful.</p><h3>Romanticising boredom is a deadly cop out</h3><p>Boredom is a sign you’re living a life designed by someone else.</p><p>You took the traditional path. You listened too much to past, pre-internet generations. You took the default career path to nowhere to climb a corporate ladder leaning against the wrong wall.</p><p>There’s nothing worse than someone that brags about being bored. This same person lives for the weekends and they can’t stop thinking about their next escapism holiday because that’s honestly all they live for at this point in life.</p><p>Boredom is a big red blinking siren that’s trying to tell you to wake the f*ck up. And if you ignore the alert it’s the equivalent of hitting the snooze button on life for an eternity.</p><p>Boredom isn’t cool. It’s the highest form of mediocrity imaginable.</p><h1>The feeling of boredom is mislabeled</h1><p>The depth of experiences we can have as humans is vast.</p><p>We live in a world that has 100K pixel clarity. Life is fascinating if you actually choose to live it.</p><p>When people say they’re bored what they’re masking is a deep dissatisfaction for life itself. When what you do in life is so painfully useless, comfortable and lacks any sort of challenge, we wrongly call it boredom.</p><p>What we should call it is failure. Or a lack of goals. Or no passion.</p><h1>Your boredom holds your unrealized potential</h1><p>Netflix won’t make you feel better. It’s a sugar pill. It’s a fake placebo.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings.</em></p><p><em>You develop patience. Boredom no longer signals the need for distraction, but rather the need for new challenges to conquer.” – Robert Greene</em></p></blockquote><p>The cure for boredom is progress.</p><p>Not huge progress either. Just tiny 1%-better-each-day forms of progress. As an example, last week I felt a bit bored writing. Medium feels more stale than my daughter’s 2 week old sandwiches at the back of the couch.</p><p>So…I thought about how I could use this temporary boredom in my writing to harness it. The answer was lying right in front of my eyes. For the last 2 years I’ve wanted to start an Instagram profile.</p><p>This week I finally did.</p><p>Now, instead of boredom, I have a new excitement for writing. It’s a new challenge. A new way of writing.</p><p>It’s more visual. I don’t know anyone on Instagram. I have no idea how to use the platform. I don’t know if I’m doing it right. I’m a pig rolling in mud and sh*t, and it feels incredible.</p><p>Boredom unlocked my potential. The next level of the writing video game has now been discovered. The truth is you can play real video games and waste your life away… or you can treat real pursuits in life like a video game and level up.</p><p>In the process you’ll go from being a bored ape manipulated by news/politics and whatever culture war is going on, into becoming a beast in your field of obsession.</p><p>Boredom is trying to help your hidden potential get unleashed. Most people try to numb the feeling instead of harnessing it. Sad.</p><h1>Here’s how to hack your boredom to make it work in your favor</h1><p>Time to become an outlier. You might even join the top 1%.</p><h3>1. The best antidote to boredom in history</h3><p>If you’re bored just follow your curiosity.</p><pre><code>What are you curious about? What can you not stop thinking about? What’s a childhood activity you’ve given up?</code></pre><p>My answer to this is music. I was a musician until my mid-20s. I haven’t touched it for a decade. Last week my daughter got a toy drum kit on loan from the toy library. She handed me the drumsticks. I felt a wave of emotion.</p><p>I used to be one of the best drummers in the world (no exaggeration). Picking up those drumsticks again awakened a giant inside of me. Now I want to spend boring moments on the weekend showing my daughter the drums.</p><p>The cure to a boring life is right under your eyes.</p><h3>2. Play this game on hard mode</h3><p>Thinking of every pursuit in life as a video game is one of the best mental models.</p><p>Most people will play video games like Fortnite. A cooler video game to play in life is entrepreneurship. Starting a business makes everything in life better. Plus if it works to even a tiny degree, you end up with money.</p><p>Money is a resource that you can reinvest into your obsession to make it even better. I like the game of money because it’s tangible, whereas a lot of people play games to win fake prizes like points or participation trophies.</p><p>Play stupid games, win stupid prizes (as they say). Play games of obsession, like entrepreneurship, and become a different person you’ll be proud of.</p><h3>3. Stop letting yourself off the hook</h3><p>People let deadly boredom run their lives because they’re not hard enough on themselves.</p><p>A mediocre life is your responsibility. If the job sucks, it’s on you. If money is always a problem, it’s on you. If every friendship or romantic relationship turns into painful loneliness, it’s on you.</p><p>The good news is when you’re to blame you can solve it. It’s how you take back control. Try being a little harder on yourself.</p><p>More discipline. A series of daily habits that are non-negotiable. An exercise routine for more energy. Less junk food that clogs up your body and steals your energy.</p><p>As long as you label bad things “self-care” you’ll keep letting the devil win.</p><h3>4. Make this powerful choice</h3><p>When boredom strikes we have two options:</p><ul><li><p>Distraction</p></li><li><p>Building</p></li></ul><p>Option one leads you to become a destroyer. To be angry. To leave nasty comments. To talk smack about successful people. To engage in mindless activities like scrolling social media at 11 PM.</p><p>Option two leads to a beautiful life. One where you solve other people’s problems. Where you become an inspiration. Where you start a movement. Where you create something new you can be proud of.</p><p>Whenever you’re bored label the feeling with either “I’m going to embrace distraction” or “I’m going to build.” I recommend the latter.</p><h1>Final Thought</h1><p>It sounds cliche as f*ck, but what you do when boredom strikes or when you have some time before or after work can either make you or destroy you.</p><p>No one tells us this though. The distraction economy doesn’t want you to know this secret because then they can’t profit off you. I have nothing to lose so I’ll tell you.</p><p>Remember: The cure for boredom is progress.</p><p>Tell me which of these ideas you loved the most and why in the comments.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

Tears pouring down my face. A car nearly hit me at 75 miles an hour. It felt scary. It felt overwhelming.</p><p>Our 4-year relationship ended in an instant. We never spoke to each other again. The future marriage ceremony by the lake, lit on fire. The unborn baby we could have had, dead. Both of them.</p><p>It felt like the worst day of my life.</p><p>My identity was tied to her. We did everything together. She was my best friend. My only friend at the time, if I’m being honest. Everyone at work knew us as the two bankers who met and fell in love.</p><p>Now what would I tell them?</p><p>I’m not sure why we broke up. It was a feeling. I had dreams of wild success. She wanted to settle down. I wanted to stay in Melbourne and she wanted to go overseas every weekend (one trip we did was 48 hours in Asia … who does that?).</p><p>Jumping on planes was exhausting. She was doing it to escape. I didn’t want to escape. I wanted to double down on my writing and be near family.</p><p>Two different people, worlds apart.</p><h1>The post breakup phase is incredible</h1><p>Once the nail was in our relationship coffin everything changed.</p><p>I became a psychopath.</p><p>People didn’t recognize me. My true obsession for writing came alive. I launched a newsletter. I wrote more. I built an online business.</p><p>I stopped living for a partner and started living for me. I built a new life. One that didn’t have to meet another person’s standards. One where I could tell my bank boss to stick his job where the sun don’t shine.</p><p>When we were together I couldn’t quit banking. It was a couple’s activity. We caught the train together. We went to the same work events. We were always together which was 99% of the problem.</p><pre><code>Obsession forces you to seek solitude.</code></pre><p>You can’t do great things if you have a needy lover handcuffed to your leg begging you to “spend time with me, baby” every 5 seconds. Obsession changes how you do love.</p><h1>Breakups come in many outrageous forms</h1><p>The title of this story makes you think it’s all about love.</p><p>Breakups aren’t exclusive to a lover though. You can have a bad breakup with a boss, job, hobby, family member (even parent), or best friend.</p><p>I had a bad breakup with a boss in 2019. I worked with this guy in banking. He was cool. We ate steaks together. We swore a lot and sipped lattes every few days.</p><p>When I quit banking I got a new job. The role had no boss and they were hiring. I recommended this mofo for the job and he got it thanks to my endorsement. Shortly after I figured out he was the devil, worse than Hitler.</p><p>Then he fired me.</p><p>A friend no more. Traitor. It hurt bad. It took me many buckets of tears and 6 months to recover. The nice end to the story is he got fired, too, and ended up in a sh*tty job in the middle of butt-f*ck nowhere. So karma’s a b*tch, as they say.</p><p>This boss breakup changed my life.</p><p>I stopped trusting employers. I went harder on my side hustle. I got a new job but I was relentless. I said no to many boss requests. I had this carefree attitude that’d terrify most business leaders.</p><p>The bags under my eyes and the look in my pupils screamed “I’m here for 5 seconds then I’m gonna love ya and leave ya for my writing obsession.”</p><p>People I worked with knew my agenda. They didn’t care. Neither did I.</p><p>My side hustle was no longer a nice option. It was make-it-happen or death. No in-between. No piss-farting around. Pure relentlessness that’d rip your face off.</p><p>A breakup feels outrageous. And rage is what you need to get to the next level of life and do something you’ll be proud of.</p><h1>Orchestrate a breakup</h1><p>There’s something in your life you need to break up with.</p><p>A boss, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, a lover/spouse, bad parent, or 7-day-a-week job from hell. This story means nothing if you don’t take action.</p><p>I freaking dare you to break up with the thing you know is no good for you. I dare you to feel the fear and do it anyway. Obsession is found on the other side of breakups.</p><p>You need a catalyst to spark change. Change leads to transformation. And a good transformation needs obsession to give it rocket fuel to move forward.</p><p>When something feels like a horrible ending, it’s usually the seed of a new beginning. Only when we fall down hard and smack our face on the gutter, do we wake up and realize we’re living a groundhog day life that ends in boredom and regrets.</p><p>Wake up. Go have a break up.</p><p>Tell me if breakups have been good for you and why in the comments below.</p><div><hr></div><p>P.S.

Some say that makes me a loser.</p><p>I’ve always been that way and thought it was a bad thing. In my 20s everyone wanted to go out and party. I just wanted to sit in my bedroom and make electronic music. When I tried to take that music out to nightclubs as a DJ, I crashed and burned.</p><p>I now see loneliness differently, and you will too (shortly).</p><h1>The discomfort of isolation</h1><p>Loneliness is uncomfortable.</p><p>When I worked in banking I had to say no a lot. No to after-work drinks. No to weekends away with other bankers. No to going to the AFL football (our bank was the major sponsor).</p><p>Each no made me feel like crap. Like I was letting people down or something was wrong with me. But if I didn’t, then I would never have had the headspace to be a writer.</p><p>Modern life is slowly making us go insane.</p><p>We can’t switch off. We can’t escape. We live in constant FOMO. We have headphones on 24/7 that destroy our hearing and leave us with a high-pitched ringing in our ears, that contributes to the insanity. It’s why modern life is a horror film.</p><p>When you always have other people’s voices playing in your headphones, you drown out your own voice. You forget who you are. You can’t hear yourself think. Therefore, you can’t be creative or solve big problems.</p><p>So what are you left with? Crippling boredom that requires endless entertainment to numb the pain.</p><p>Loneliness starts out as uncomfortable because most of us don’t do it. Even when we are alone we have Netflix or our phone to talk with us. We’re truly never alone.</p><p>To unlock your inner genius you must embrace isolation for a long enough time.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“He moves fastest who moves alone.” ―&nbsp;Milton Friedman</p></div><h1>Lean into your dark side</h1><p>All of us have a dark side.</p><p>We unlock it when we’re alone. A recent example is Ben Affleck. He married Jennifer Lopez who he thought was the love of his life after decades of wanting one another.</p><p>Within two years they’re getting a divorce. This love affair started almost 20 years ago. Sources close to Ben say he has a dark side. He can never be fully present because he needs extended periods of solitude.</p><pre><code>It’s this alone time that has made him one of the greatest actors of our time.</code></pre><p>But his ex-wife JLO didn’t understand it. She wanted him to always be present. To always want to go away or be in the spotlight. On their honeymoon Ben and JLO had paparazzi around them all the time.</p><p>It led Ben to madness. So their marriage ended.</p><p>I can relate to this. Thankfully my wife knows I need solitude. She also likes the same alone time, so it works well for us.</p><p>In my banking days, I remember working out of a bank branch. All the other bankers would go home at 5 PM. I’d stay back. I’d finish my banking work at 5 PM and stick around to record podcasts with successful people. Or I’d stay there and write.</p><p>Most nights I wouldn’t leave before 9 or 10 PM. I stayed so late one night that I slept in my car. I was obsessed with this new life I’d found. I wanted to exit banking as quickly as possible, but knew only loneliness would get me there.</p><p>The other bankers used to make fun of me. They said I lived at the office. Bosses thought it was awesome. But no one knew I lived at the office to build my own thing, not do useless banking work like open bank accounts for customers.</p><p>Your dark side is where hidden potential is found. It comes out to play after hours.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Being alone is a power very few can handle” – Aaron Will</em></p></blockquote><h1>Success isn’t complicated (but everyone thinks it is)</h1><p>When I see complicated paths to success, I see bullsh*t.</p><p>Loneliness is a powerful tool to get anything you want in life. If you do it for 90 days everything will change in your life. Here’s the thing: <em>I can’t promise you what will change because it’s different for everyone.</em></p><p>What I know is loneliness forces you to rediscover who you are.</p><p>You won’t come out the other side of 90 days of deep solitude the same person. It’s exciting. It’s breathtaking. But it takes a level of discomfort most can’t handle.</p><p>The first few days are like being 48 hours into a water fast. This memory stands out as I’m 8 weeks away from another stint in hospital. Before I go under the knife, I’ll have to fast beforehand so it’s safe for the anesthetic.</p><p>As the hunger sets in so too will the darkness.</p><p>I’ve been down this road since 2015. First, I’ll wonder whether the cancer comes back. Then I’ll stress about the hospital because I hate needles and blood. This time I’ll stress harder because I have a 1 year old daughter. What if the hospital goes wrong?</p><p>But as wild as it sounds, I look forward to this darkness.</p><p>It’s deeply motivating. It interrupts my thought patterns and I come out the other side 10x more grateful than the average person who takes everything for granted.</p><p>The fasting will require solitude. The recovery in the hospital will require solitude, too. I wonder what the loneliness will teach me this time?</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Time alone isn’t lonely, it’s freedom” – OrangeBook</p></div><h1>90 days is all it takes to rediscover who you are</h1><p>My challenge to you is to embrace 90 days of loneliness.</p><p>Here’s what to do in the 90 days:</p><ul><li><p>Delete all your goals. Start again.</p></li><li><p>Start writing daily online so you can use it to think deeply.</p></li><li><p>Create a new vision for your life. Dream big.

I hit this milestone years ago from writing online. That means I get emails every day from people wanting to do the same.</p><p>Here’s my blanket response for how I made $1M from writing online.</p><h1>1. Write on social media</h1><p>Every day. Pick a topic you are crazy about. Reply to people’s comments. Have fun. Format your writing so it can be read on a phone. Ignore hateful comments.</p><h1>2. Don’t try to monetize on day one</h1><p>Focus on building a small audience first. Figure out what they want. Find their problems. When you find them, look for the pain.</p><p>Create a service to solve the problem. Promote it to your tiny audience. Make some money. Consider turning that service into a digital product to create more leverage.</p><h1>3. Have your life fall apart</h1><p>Wake up one morning and open your computer. Sip a cup of coffee. Smile at your crypto fortune. See all the Stripe emails for product sales. Think you’re a big shot. Consider ripping out a cigar and posting a selfie of you smoking it on social media.</p><p>For fun, check your digital wallet. Notice a withdrawal of more than $1M.</p><p>Fall to the floor. Nearly have a heart attack. Contact your best friend who works in crypto. Have him say “It’s gone, mate.” Have coffee with him later that day. Explain how you now know why a person can jump in front of a train.</p><p>Go home. Face your wife. Tell her you love her, then share the bad news. Watch the dreams of her first home go up in smoke with the look she gives. See nuclear mushroom clouds in her eyes. The woman you loved. Heartbroken. Speechless.</p><p>Go back to your office. Write. Make money online. Feel like sh*t. <em>This is the first ripple.</em></p><p>Because you now can’t afford a home, look around for a new house to rent. Go to the open for inspections. Have your rental applications turned down. Wait in line while hundreds of people try to rent the same property as you.</p><p>Be reminded that record-high property prices are the cause. No one can afford to buy so they rent. Be reminded how $1M was supposed to exclude you from this problem. Now you’ve gotta face it like everyone else.</p><p>Be humbled.</p><p>Eventually rent a new home under an airport flight path. Get woken up by helicopters flying overhead all day and night. Then, find out you’re going to be a parent. Be simultaneously joyful and terrified at the same time. Where will the baby sleep? How will the baby sleep?</p><p>Realize this is now the ripple effect at play and this is <em>the second ripple.</em></p><p>Rush your partner to the hospital. Baby is coming fast. Nurses everywhere. It’s all going to plan. Suddenly an alarm sounds. Doctors rush in. Your daughter’s heart rate is dropping. You could lose the baby. Blood everywhere. Needles. Gas.</p><p>Your daughter is born. She’s incredible. She pisses all over your new sweater and leaves a yellow stain. You smile. You kiss her. She can do no wrong. Perfection. Joy. <em>This is the third ripple.</em></p><p>Start looking for a new home (again). Go to house auctions in between writing and making money online. Lose every auction by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Be reminded again of the money that was stolen from you and what it could’ve done in this situation.</p><p>Keep trying. Try to have hope when it feels like there’s none. Finally find a house. Get excited. Make an early offer. Have the owner accept it. See the smile on your partner’s face. Move in. Feel on top of the world. Paint the walls. Get the grass redone. Install a big screen TV. Feel like you’ve made it.</p><p>One night, get woken up by loud music. Wonder what the hell is going on. Investigate. Discover you have a bad neighbor who believes they are above the law.</p><p>Get frustrated. Blow up. Go over and yell at them. Say things you wish you didn’t. Take them through the legal system. Sleepless nights. Waste a year of your life. Lose. Community organizations are above the law and have friends in local government. <em>This is the fourth ripple.</em></p><p>At the end of the legal battle you feel exhausted. You realize it’s taken a toll on your marriage. Your partner is not happy with you. You’ve let them down. You’ve spent too much time away from them dealing with this issue.</p><p>Make the difficult decision to get marriage counseling.</p><p>Feel like crap. Feel like a failed parent. Feel like you’ve let your daughter down. Enter the therapist’s office and feel like you’ve time-traveled back a decade, when you faced extreme mental illness. Remember the dark times. Have them haunt you.</p><p>Show up to couple’s therapy. See someone you know in the waiting area. Feel like even more of a loser. Tell no one. Keep it a secret. Pretend you’re okay. Act like a happy couple outside of therapy.</p><p>Wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares of divorce.</p><p>Imagine raising a child in a broken family in a broken 19070s home. Visualize the look on your kid’s face. Wake up the next day and commit to work on yourself. Try to find the source of the problem that led to therapy. Realize it’s you. <em>This is the fifth ripple.</em></p><p>Keep showing up to therapy. Listen. Notice the situation at home getting better. See the relief on your daughter’s face. Have the therapist make a strange comment. “Newly married couples with young children see me all the time. It’s normal. Getting therapy as a precaution is a sign of love, not a failing marriage.”</p><p>Feel relieved.</p><p>Late one afternoon you start writing a newsletter. You realize that everything in life is downstream of the ripple effect. One tiny event can trigger a series of other events. You can either make the ripples positive or negative. Making large sums of money has little to do with knowledge and more to do with what you’re putting out into the world each day.</p><p>You attract what you give. Create positive ripple effects for others and watch them reverberate back in your life.</p><h1>4.

Dinner parties are weird. Neighborly chats in the street feel off. “Going out with friends” is a struggle.</p><p>As soon as I talk it’s like I’m an alien. It’s why I still tell people I’m a banker because if I told them what I really did, which doesn’t fit into any defined career path, they’d be so confused they’d tune out.</p><p>Being an outcast is a daily struggle.</p><p>And it’s the kind of struggle we should embrace. When I talk about being an outcast some people get confused. They think I’m talking about being a weirdo or wearing rainbow-colored pants to the supermarket sometimes. Nope.</p><p>An outcast is someone who doesn’t fit in. They’re outspoken. And most of all, they hate the mainstream narrative and avoid it like a bat virus plague.</p><p>Here’s why being an outcast is a superpower that you must embrace.</p><h1>“Fitting in” has the worst rewards in history</h1><p>When you try to fit in you become someone you’re not.</p><p>That means you’re a Hollywood actor jumping through circus hoops trying to do a strip dance for an audience of strangers. Fitting in means not being yourself, and it’s the secret goal of most people.</p><p>If you break down people’s fears, like I have through my fearless writer challenge, you realize the average person doesn’t want to rock the boat or speak out of turn.</p><p>They’re worried they’ll be canceled or face a moment of public embarrassment, where their execution is televised for the world to see.</p><p>Outcasts know this powerful truth: <strong>nobody gives a sh*t.</strong></p><p>Nobody gives a sh*t about your career.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about if you’re poor.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about whether you’re happy.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about what you write online.<br>Nobody gives a sh*t about whatever personal tragedy you’re facing.</p><p>All the average person gives a sh*t about is themselves.</p><p>We’re now all drowning in so many day-to-day problems we don’t have mental bandwidth to deal with anyone else’s. 24/7 news cycles, phone notifications, a full-time career, a lifetime of daily emails to open and delete, a to-do list a mile long.</p><p>The modern human is busier than ever so they don’t have time to give a damn about you. And that’s the best news you will hear for the rest of this decade.</p><h3>If you fit in you’re replaceable.</h3><p>Fitting in means copying others.</p><p>It means you walk and talk the same. It means you wear a penguin suit to work so you look like all the other penguins hoping for a big annual bonus and a juicy promotion.</p><p>It means you watch Marvel superhero movies and consume the same Netflix tv series that every other monkey in a clown suit is drowning themselves in so they can numb the pain of their normal life into next year.</p><ul><li><p>Fitting in means 6-figures of debt for a useless college degree.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means living next to the Joneses in the suburbs and trying to one-up them every year with a house renovation or new car.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means choosing a traditional career path, where your creativity and imagination is suppressed so hard you start to internally combust and sh*t out your mouth.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means taking on a home loan to buy a house you can’t afford that you’ll be paying off for the rest of your life. The recurring debt payments mean you can’t take lots of time off work. You must be heavily money-focused for the rest of your life. Always keeping score.</p></li><li><p>Fitting in means being less than you can be so you don’t shine too bright.</p></li></ul><p>This is a nightmare way to live that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy, Matt (screw you if you’re reading, matey, you piece of cr*p).</p><pre><code>The traditional path is the path to nowhere.</code></pre><p>In a world of massive technological change, artificial intelligence that leads to infinite intelligence, low cost or even $0 electricity thanks to nuclear energy, and human labor no longer needed because of robots… doing what humans always did is the path to 1930s depression-like poverty and mental illness.</p><p>If you follow the conventional path you’re replaceable.</p><p>If you follow your curiosity anything is possible.</p><h1>Being an outcast creates loneliness which is a superpower</h1><p>Sometimes it’s lonely for me to be an outcast.</p><p>I feel like I don’t belong. But more and more I’m realizing solitude is a powerful habit. When you’re alone you can think deeply. My best creative work comes from periods of loneliness. Time alone lets me shut out the noise and focus.</p><p>The flow states that follow we’ll knock most people to the floor.</p><p>3 years of work in a week is no joke when you embrace solitude and let it lead to flow states. Maybe the real problem is that humans need to spend too much time socializing so they feel like they belong to something.</p><p>In the process, they don’t have enough time to achieve their big goals.</p><p>Show me someone who’s okay to be lonely, and I’ll show you an outcast who will go on to do great things and change the world.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It’s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone.” — Robin Williams</p></div><h1>Common sense is daylight robbery for your future</h1><p>Screw being normal.</p><p>Normal people follow the mainstream narrative. They argue over politics like it’s going to save their lives. Red versus Blue thinking in America is the worst. What if Red and Blue are both part of the same side?</p><p>Election promises are bullsh*t. When you’ve only got the top job for 4 years you’ll say anything. If you deliver on none of your promises there are no consequences.</p><blockquote><p>If a guy who’s in his 80s and can hardly string together two words is in charge of the greatest nation on the planet, what does that say?</p></blockquote><p>He’s not running anything. Someone is but it’s not Joe, Kamala, or Orange Man.</p><p>I don’t believe in conspiracy theories, so my best guess is the richest Americans run the U.S. and they use their money to manipulate congress through lobbying. This is why the mainstream narrative is a clown show.</p><p>All it does is outsource your control to a 3rd party where you have no control. People tell outcasts like me to follow common sense.</p><p>That means taking pharmaceutical pills, murdering loads of animals so I can eat, watching news designed to make me mad, getting into debt through toxic consumerism behaviour, and watching my savings erode to nothing thanks to underreported inflation and money printing.</p><p>Common sense is insanity.</p><p>Outcasts question everything. They even question the fact-checkers themselves.</p><h1>Being an outcast is a deep human experience that bends reality</h1><p>I never fit in at school.</p><p>There were three groups: Aussies, Europeans (Greeks/Italians), and Chinese. The Aussies rejected me because I didn’t care about driving fast muscle cars or throwing a shrimp on the barbie. No thanks, mate.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg" width="234" height="359.775" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:984,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:234,&quot;bytes&quot;:124382,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290981e6-c7f0-4f6a-991c-0b2f4f5439a7_640x984.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Image credit: Wikipedia Creative Commons (1984 Paul Hogan ad for Australia)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>I tried to fit in with the Europeans but their parents told them not to hang around Aussies like me.</p><p>Because of their racism, within 6 months of being in high school, my 3 best Italian friends would no longer speak to me. They ran away whenever I came near them. I tried with the Chinese, too, but I couldn’t speak their language so they looked at me and smiled.</p><p>By the end of high school, I decided university wasn’t for me.</p><p>My school didn’t know what to do with me. They told me to leave so I did. I ended up studying sound engineering with no prior experience. I had to lie about my age to get in at 16 years old when I should have been 18 and had a high school diploma.</p><p>In adult life, I decided to marry my wife who is from China. Aussies didn’t get it. They made fun of me. <strong>One Medium dot com article ridiculed me and said I was a s*xpat.</strong></p><p>I’d never heard this word before.</p><p>Nowadays, when I go to pick up my daughter from daycare I get all sorts of strange looks. Only mothers pick up their kids at our daycare. The dads are all at work. When I take my daughter swimming I’m the only dad. The other parents are all mothers.</p><p>They all look at me with this strange facial expression that says: “why isn’t he at an office job providing for his family?”</p><p>Office jobs made me depressed. That’s why. And gender-allocated roles are silly.</p><p>When I was 6 years old my two best friends were Sri Lankan. We played cricket and ate curry every day. As a teenager many of my friends were Muslim.</p><p>I fasted with them during Ramadan. I even went to the mosque with them. Now, in my 30s, I go to Jewish Passover every year with friends and even read ancient passages.</p><p>When you don’t fit in and embrace other cultures your human experience is way more nuanced. You eat food from different parts of the world. You speak different languages. You go places others are afraid to go.</p><p>Black and white thinking and being stuck in a bubble is worse than being an outcast.</p><p>The full human experience is understanding all humans, not just the rednecks in your own backyard.</p><h1>See things differently and tell it as it is</h1><p>I don’t sugarcoat anything.</p><p>I learned this from my former buddha boss, who’s one of the most interesting outcasts I’ve ever come across. He tells it how it is.</p><p>If the IT systems at the bank are blowing up, he tells you. “It’s bad. Very bad.” His counterparts would try to make it sound like everything was fine which led to more devastation. Not buddha boss man.</p><pre><code>An outcast sees things differently which is why they’re often isolated or treated badly.</code></pre><p>I find hanging around outcasts useful because of this. I want to know what other viewpoints exist on a topic. If everyone is looking at an issue from the front, I like to talk to an outcast and get the upside-down view.</p><p>Growth only happens when we’re forced to stretch ourselves to the point of discomfort.</p><h1>The world is moving towards a “category of one”</h1><p>There’s a logical reason why more of us feel like outcasts.</p><p>I often say to writers “you are the niche.” Writer Mike Goitein said to me in a chat “we are all a category of one.”</p><p>As more of us begin to embrace social media, we no longer fit inside of neat boxes anymore. None of us are single-topic humans. We’re not single-industry humans either. The trend of being a one-person business is catching on.</p><p>When you go from believing you’re an employee with a boss, to believing you’re a one-person with one customer (an employer) or multiple clients, your thinking starts to shift. The limitations the world wants to put on you in the form of niches, job titles, and labels don’t make sense anymore.</p><p>The more of us that go through this transformation, the more outcasts we will have.</p><h1>Being an outcast is the highest form of compliment in existence</h1><p>Let’s finish here.</p><p>Being an outcast is a massive compliment. Embrace it. It means you’re not being brainwashed. Instead, you’re programming your own mind.

I can’t explain how much I miss you and how often I think about you. I would say at least 50 times a day. </p><p>If I could push pause and freeze my life for a moment it would be with you in the hammock listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/yYcyacLRPNs?si=q8MeKyqgxtdO86kE&amp;t=33">this song</a> on our last day together. Your body had given up but you were so warm, so cosy and so happy. I was hiding the tears in my eyes. Me and you had known for a while this moment was coming and we hadn’t wasted a second. </p><p>You really taught me how to live life in the 6 months I knew you Tina and you left a huge impact not just on me but on the world. </p><p>You might no longer be here physically Tina but I wanted to tell you how you are still everywhere…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png" width="1348" height="770" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:770,&quot;width&quot;:1348,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2536629,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d07a3a6-5b4d-4b10-be01-ad6e8e367dd5_1348x770.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>You Made Me A Better Person</h3><p>You won’t believe how hard things got after you passed Tina. I’m sure they are all sitting beside you playing now but a week after you I also lost Snoop. A couple of months later Derek and Jumbo also left this world. It was one of the hardest few months in my life. The 4 of you were such wonderful dogs and the house was very quiet. I hope you are sharing tennis balls with the boys and all keeping each other safe. </p><p>What got me through that time and other tough moments was one thing Tina. It was thinking about you. Any challenge I’ve faced this past year (there have been many) I just think of your face and your soft nature. </p><p>I think my own sobriety, depression and anxiety was already in control when I met you but you cemented the recovery. When I whispered in your ear a year ago that I would never let you or all the other dogs down it was an unbreakable promise.

I’m sitting here writing beside <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-cy3bQvnEO/">Bowie and her 6 puppies</a> and I can’t help but think what a great mum you’d have been if you were given the chance. </p><p>You won’t believe it Tina but we’ve managed to sterilise <a href="https://www.happydoggo.com/our-work">20,000 dogs since the day you passed</a>. We do it with 9 wonderful partners in 3 countries. It’s a big number to think about Tina but we estimate that might have stopped 200,000+ dogs being born into suffering like you. </p><p>It wouldn’t be right to for me and you to take credit for it Tina as there are SO SO many people involved and so much money to raise and logistics to plan.

Founded in 2023, Avra runs a selective program for the world’s best growth-stage entrepreneurs. It helps the leaders of breakout businesses learn how to build an executive team, maintain shipping speed, and plan for the future. It’s a kind of doctoral program for startup CEOs, albeit one with a well-guarded curriculum and a venture fund on the back end.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning from Y Combinator</strong>. Avra’s team previously worked together at YC Continuity, the growth practice of the famed accelerator. When YC suddenly shuttered that division in March 2023, Avra founder Anu Hariharan put her plans for a new growth program into high gear, bringing colleagues with her.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>A missing piece</strong>. Though YC is still recognized as the best launchpad for early-stage startups, it has competition from dozens of other incubators and accelerators. Avra is the first of its kind: a high-quality standalone program for post-Series A companies. As a result, the fund has the opportunity to establish itself as a standard bearer for later stage startups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tactical masterclasses</strong>. Avra’s program is taught by some of the startup ecosystem’s most impressive and successful founders. Sessions cover choosing the right metrics, hiring executives, scaling engineering, leveling up financial planning, and preparing for future fundraises. Each one is a tactical masterclass full of detail.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Reordering VC</strong>. Though Avra’s principal mission is to assist founders through targeted education, it monetizes as a venture firm. It is raising a reported $350 million to invest in a small fraction of the startups that pass through its program. It’s a clever strategy that reorders the traditional sequence venture capital follows. Rather than winning a deal and <em>then </em>adding value, Avra does the work upfront, proving its impact and building rapport ahead of a future round.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Benedict Evans, analyst and erstwhile investor, once referred to Andreessen Horowitz as “a media company that monetizes through VC.” It was a pithy description of his former employer that got to the heart of the firm’s forceful brand building strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra Capital is a trade school that monetizes through VC.&nbsp;</p><p>In almost all of its core functionality, Avra appears to be a small-batch institution of higher learning. It runs bi-annual cohorts, holds classes, doles out required reading, and assigns homework. What distinguishes Avra from other vocational programs is the trade that it teaches, and the student body it admits.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra is not focused on nursing, HVAC repair, or aeronautics but on the craft of company building. Its student body is made up of many of this generation’s most promising founders—the people behind some of the world’s hottest startups, vying to become tech’s next big winner.&nbsp;</p><p>All matriculate to learn directly from founders who have overcome the obstacles they currently face. Walk the imagined hallways of Avra Academy, and you’ll pass the bronze nameplates of its luminary educators: Professor Parker Conrad of Compound Software, Visiting Scholar Greg Schott of Enterprise Sales, and Dean Tony Xu, Head of Urban Scanning.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra’s top-tier instructors and effective playbook owe a great deal to the experience of its founder, Anu Hariharan. Starting in 2016, Hariharan ran Y Combinator’s Growth team, backing companies like Brex, Monzo, Gusto, Zepto, Groww, Rappi and Faire. As part of that role, she and co-head Ali Rowghani managed the accelerator’s post-Series A program, designed to help breakout companies manage the next phase of their growth. When YC President Garry Tan abruptly shut down the division in March 2023, Hariharan and several colleagues used seven years of lessons to found Avra.&nbsp;</p><p>Given Hariharan’s bonafides and the quality of Avra’s instruction, it’s little wonder that attaining entrance to the fund’s program has grown increasingly competitive in just its first year of operation. The chance to attend small, tactical sessions with legendary entrepreneurs is attractive to many – not least when delivered in the vulnerable, off-the-record style that Avra encourages. It wants its students not simply to understand how DoorDash’s CEO recruits his C-Suite, for example, but to hear the mistakes and lessons learned along the way.</p><p>That frankness is why Avra guards the content of its curriculum so closely. It is one thing to ask a founder to regale an audience of junior peers with a parade of mistakes, quite another to make those battle scars visible to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps because of its combination of secrecy and cache, Avra (and YC Growth before it) represents a tantalizing prospect for outsiders. Visit its site, and you’ll find glowing testimonials from alumni but little in the way of tangible detail. How do great CEOs scale their engineering teams? What quirks enable tech companies to maintain a rapid shipping speed? In short, what does a school for super-scalers actually look like from the inside? What do exceptional founders know that the rest of us don’t?</p><p>Over the past nine months, The Generalist has been given unprecedented access to Avra’s program, experiencing it as a student might. That includes accessing its classes, program material, and alumni resources.</p><p>It proved an illuminating process, giving me insight into Avra’s unusual advantages in the venture landscape and a fiercer appreciation for the grit, guile, intensity, and consistency it takes to build a generational business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The making of a VC</h2><p>Anu Hariharan made her decision. After much deliberation and research, she’d elected to choose three promising growth-stage companies: online grocery delivery provider Instacart, travel marketplace GetYourGuide, and on-demand storage player MakeSpace.</p><p>It represented an unusual sort of investment decision—freighted by high stakes but with no money on the line. It was part of the interview process with a New York City hedge fund interested in venture investing—“you can probably easily guess who,” she says—and Hariharan had been tasked with pitching a trio of compelling Series B startups.</p><p>It was a tricky task for a former Qualcomm engineer and Boston Consulting Group principal with no venture capital experience and little familiarity with the tech landscape. “I didn’t even know what Series B was,” Hariharan recalled. “I didn’t know anything about startups. I didn’t even read TechCrunch.”</p><p>Eleven years later, we know that Hariharan picked well. Instacart was valued at <a href="https://equable.org/instacart-and-valuation-risk/#:~:text=The%20Series%20A%20round%20in,in%20a%20%24354%20million%20valuation.">$25.4 million</a> in its 2013 Series A; today, it trades at $9.5 billion. The Berlin-based GetYourGuide raised $194 million in debt and equity in 2023 at a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/travel-firm-getyourguide-raises-194-million-at-2-billion-valuation.html">$2 billion valuation</a>; it had raised approximately $20 million at the time Hariharan assessed it. Only MakeSpace can be considered a miss, merging with rival firm Clutter, which subsequently sold at a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/storage-startup-clutter-running-out-of-cash-sells-itself-at-steep-discount?rc=jtsqvx">steep discount</a> last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsure of her selections and eager for a more experienced opinion, Hariharan reached out to seasoned investors, asking for their advice. That act summarized Hariharan’s direct, unflappable approach to problem solving, and changed the course of her career.&nbsp;</p><p>“I sent cold emails to four VCs saying, “I’m interviewing at this fund, and I would love any feedback on the three companies I’ve picked to pitch,’” Hariharan recalled. “One of the people I emailed happened to be Jeff Jordan.”</p><p>As it turned out, Jordan was the perfect recipient for Hariharan’s message. Not only had he spent time at BCG before rising through the ranks at Disney, stepping in as President of PayPal, co-founding OpenTable and Wealthfront, and arriving at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), but he was also actively researching Instacart.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg" width="1200" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125501,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdc5ce99-6e17-4a03-af03-aec0c388a035_1200x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Anu Hariharan impressed Jeff Jordan to get a foothold in venture capital (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure></div><p>“I didn’t realize that he was diligencing them for the Series B,” Hariharan said. “He thought my diligence was pretty good and pretty interesting, so we started going back and forth on emails. And then he said, “Whenever you’re in San Francisco next, I’d love to meet you.”</p><p>Rather than leave the encounter to fate, Hariharan said she’d be in town the next week and booked a ticket. When she arrived at a16z’s office, Jordan surprised her with a few additions to her agenda. “I thought I was meeting just him, but he’d arranged eight meetings for me with everyone else at the firm,” Hariharan said.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, Hariharan was offered a job on a16z’s investment team. It marked the beginning of her venture career and the start of a breakneck education in a new kind of investing.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Hariharan had spent much of her time at BCG in the firm’s private equity practice, conducting detailed due diligence on potential investments, VC required her to adjust her perspective. “I had to recalibrate my thought process from PE to VC. After every pitch meeting, Jeff would ask me to articulate my point of view within five minutes. He also helped me focus on how to identify founders because so much of venture is about picking the right person.”</p><p>In addition to paying closer attention to entrepreneurs, Hariharan had to learn to let go of some of the conservatism her private equity experience had inculcated in her. A lunch meeting with firm co-founder Marc Andreessen encouraged her to focus more on a company’s potential than its risks.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was sometime around my nine-month mark at a16z,” Hariharan recalled. “He told me that usually, when he onboards someone, he has to teach them not to say yes to too many investments. But for me, he was going to have to teach me to say yes to one of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Andreessen told her that a VC’s biggest mistakes were ones of omission – the great companies that you should have invested in but didn’t. He urged Hariharan to apply her analytical brain to investigating a startup’s upside, developing the conviction to take a swing.&nbsp;</p><p>Hariharan cites Chris Dixon and Ben Horowitz as additional influences during this stage of her venture schooling. “Ben is exceptional at B2B SaaS – I learned a lot from how he dug into whether a sales team was working and the go-to-market metrics. Chris is just one of the most intelligent thesis-based investors I’ve ever seen.” Hariharan took lessons from both of them.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg" width="1024" height="684" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:684,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:474018,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e5ac5f-8134-4223-96c3-3c5458edb2e5_1024x684.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Anu Hariharan learned from both Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz (Press Farm)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Although Hariharan may have been a greenhorn when it came to the venture asset class, she entered the industry with technical expertise, strategic experience, and a natural nose for investing. She tells the story of her entry into venture capital with deep humility – casting herself as a learner, above all else – but Hariharan’s fast rise is a testament to her talents. Spend even a few minutes with her, and you cannot help but notice her striking but unflashy intellect, a direct, genial speaking style, and substance. Her long-time colleague Nic Dardenne summarized Hariharan’s gifts eloquently. “There are two things: one, she works insanely hard. She’s an incredibly successful person but is also the hardest-working person I know, both for the team and the founders she works with. Two, she does right by founders. She has this superpower of telling people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear, but doing so in a way that endears herself to them and makes them trust her even more.”&nbsp;</p><p>Not long into her second year at a16z and another Silicon Valley institution had started noticing her talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Altman, then President of Y Combinator, had decided to launch a growth practice designed to double down on the accelerator’s best-performing businesses. He sought two general partners to run “YC Continuity,” with existing Managing Director Ali Rowghani—the former CFO and COO of Twitter—slated to step into one of those roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her relatively short tenure in venture, Hariharan had already made an impact on the YC community, developing a relationship with several of the ecosystem’s startups. “We worked with a lot of YC founders at Andreessen Horowitz,” she said. “One of YC’s partners pinged me and said they’d heard my name a lot and asked if I’d be open to having a conversation about the growth fund they were planning to launch.”&nbsp;</p><p>She was. Though Hariharan enjoyed her time at a16z, there was no path to a partner at the time – significant for someone who had been on the partner track at BCG. After she completed a two-year stint, she planned to step into an operating role at one of the firm’s portfolio companies. “I was on the path to be the CFO of one of the startups we’d invested in,” Hariharan reflected. “I never felt like I needed to be an investor. My goal is always around learning and impact. I thought, ‘Maybe I can go to a portfolio company and do that for four or five years.’”</p><p>Altman’s interest forced her to reconsider that plan. “YC is such an amazing place and a very differentiated platform,” Hariharan said. “I think it’s unlike any other VC. It’s <em>not</em> really a VC fund.” Over a few months, Hariharan got to know the team better, and by August 2016, she’d decided to join as YC Continuity’s second managing director.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Continuity</h2><p>Though Hariharan intended to stay four years at Y Combinator, she lasted seven. That duration is a consequence of the compelling power of YC’s platform, the value the Continuity practice created, and the abruptness with which it was shuttered.&nbsp;</p><p>But we should not rush ahead. When Hariharan joined Ali Rowghani in 2016, the pair were tasked with building out a new practice under the auspices of Y Combinator. In addition to functioning as a growth-stage investor, Continuity was expected to build a curriculum and operate a program of its own.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:73249,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c173a2a-2af2-4221-b588-bc6c7715b63e_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Ali Rowghani, Hariharan's partner at YC Continuity (YC)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Much of that mission aligned with Y Combinator’s roots, of course. Ever since its founding in 2005, it had operated a de-facto “founder school,” teaching unseasoned founders how to build startups. Its syllabus – devised by Paul Graham and honed by countless partners and practitioners – accelerated the trajectories of companies like Reddit, Airbnb, Stripe, and Flexport.</p><p>Continuity would do the same, albeit for a different audience and with some critical tweaks. Rather than assisting scarcely-formed projects, it would work with established startups, rapidly scaling revenue and headcount. That contrasting focus necessitated changes to YC’s classic syllabus and the program's structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of serving 50, 100, or even 400 startups a batch, Continuity worked with 8-12. Rather than focusing on finding product-market fit, Hariharan and Rowghani counseled founders on scaling as CEOs, hiring executives, maintaining shipping speed, plowing through plateauing growth, and raising later-stage rounds. And because those topics require detailed tactical knowledge and emotional credibility, Continuity primarily relied on active founders – those still “in the arena” – to teach its courses. Plaid’s Zach Perret and Webflow’s Vlad Magalin both taught for Hariharan’s program.&nbsp;</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;45a535aa-6c85-4b73-b1b0-92df7ea8baaf&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The Generalist delivers in-depth analysis and insights on the world's most successful companies, executives, and technologies.

It didn’t hurt that the growth program stood alone in the competitive landscape. Although myriad accelerators like Techstars and 500 Startups had cropped up to vie for early-stage founders, no dominant program existed for scalers. “I don’t think anyone runs something similar,” Hariharan said. “Even now that I’m on the outside and have spent all this time learning about founder programs, I still haven’t found anyone who does it – at least not as well.”</p><p>In part, that’s because of the network and wisdom Continuity was able to glean from its parent company. “I think we learned the art of doing it well because we got to see how well YC did it for the early stage,” Hariharan reasoned. “It’s not easy to do without that.”</p><p>Though Continuity saw itself principally as an educator, it monetized like YC – via investments. Once again, it did so with a twist. While YC makes investment a requirement to participate – you cannot attend the program without accepting its “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=yc+standard+terms&amp;oq=yc+standard+terms&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Standard Deal</a>” – Continuity operated opportunistically, investing in a select number of companies only when the right moment arrived. Not only was this a logical reflection of later-stage funding rounds, but it also meant that companies that matriculated to Continuity did so with no strings attached. The vast majority of graduates never received capital from Hariharan and Rowghani; of the approximately 180 that went through the program, Continuity backed just a fraction of them.&nbsp;</p><p>As she had at a16z, Hariharan continued to learn from those around her, not least future OpenAI’s supreme leader, Sam Altman. In particular, Altman exhorted Hariharan to test her conviction and size bets aggressively. “Sam had this characteristic of asking, ‘Are you betting the house?’” Hariharan recalled. “It was his way of understanding if you had high conviction on an investment. Either you have full conviction, or you don’t. If you’re on the fence, why are you doing this? And if you have full conviction, why aren’t you doing more? It’s a simplistic framework, but I appreciate how much clarity it brings to investment decisions. That’s the biggest thing I learned from Sam.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg" width="437" height="656.7005494505495" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2188,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:437,&quot;bytes&quot;:11301954,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3430f62-77d3-451b-aa14-e1a4864027a1_3327x5000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sam Altman ran Y Combinator when Hariharan first joined (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure></div><p>According to Hariharan, Altman’s heuristic made a noticeable difference on Continuity’s investing style over time. In its first fund, the growth team approached capital-intensive businesses cautiously, even if a large addressable market might have justified a bolder strategy. By its last fund, Continuity had learned to lean in. “We were a little gun shy when the risk was higher, but then by the third fund, we were more aggressive. When we saw Zepto, which is a 10-minute quick commerce player in India, we bet the house. It wasn’t clear it was going to be a breakout, but it is today.”</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;30ac103f-5e3e-4028-939d-37d3f9c1695a&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Actionable insights&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Y Combinator: The Institute of Innovation&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:9653721,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mario Gabriele&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Founder of The Generalist&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5007322-b272-4faa-9489-8f159a07e65a_1205x1297.jpeg&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:1000}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2022-07-17T21:27:53.509Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25281e3-b354-452d-a2cb-7fa9bb002e17_2700x2100.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/y-combinator-the-institute-of-innovation&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:64527490,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:10,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Generalist&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2dfe63cd-67ea-49ba-92df-930520a822a0_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p>Hariharan and Rowghani were not alone in making these investment decisions. Their growth practice grew to include Nic Dardenne, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, and Tiffany Kosolcharoen, who conducted market intelligence at Meta.&nbsp;</p><p>Dardenne operated as a traditional growth investor, albeit one with a particular gift for grasping a company’s financials. A colleague likened his role to that of a “mini CFO” for some of the companies he works with, helping to retool their models from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>Kosolcharoen served in a slightly different capacity. At Meta, she built out the market intelligence systems and conducted research for a portfolio of products. At&nbsp;YC Continuity, she was brought on as Head of Investment Research, tasked with monitoring the accelerator’s many companies and spotting candidates for additional capital. Through this process, Continuity quickly spotted the steep trajectory of startups like Deel and Zip before they raised Series A rounds. That allowed the Continuity team to build a relationship and lead later investments.&nbsp;</p><p>Over Continuity’s seven-year run, it pulled together a promising portfolio, many of which have repaid its investment many times over. Hariharan and Rowghani’s prominent bets include Stripe, Coinbase, Faire, Monzo, Groww, Vanta, Segment, Rappi, Gusto, and Brex. Naturally, not all have been hits – in October 2023, trucking firm Convoy, a Continuity investment, shut down operations after consuming over $1 billion in capital. Nevertheless, on balance, Hariharan’s team seems to have done remarkably well. “My hope is that in time, we’ll show that we had one of the best growth track records during that period,” Tiffany Kosolcharoen said.&nbsp;</p><p>Brex represented a particularly significant investment for Hariharan. Not only did she preempt a pricey Series B round for a company that had little revenue in 2018 – a decision that was spectacularly vindicated in the following years—but she also found a future colleague.&nbsp;</p><p>Serving on Brex’s board introduced her to Lucas Fox, an early employee who would go on to manage its startup business unit. The pair became frequent collaborators, with Fox struck by the intensity with which Hariharan was willing to graft on behalf of the company. “She was almost like an exec at Brex. We worked really closely together – we’d go on three-to-five-day work binges when we were trying to solve a problem together.” Sometimes, when Fox was tackling a particularly thorny issue, he’d stay at Hariharan’s family home for days at a time.&nbsp;</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;6fe9f735-c1ae-48cc-870d-43eb7bacf300&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The Generalist delivers in-depth analysis and insights on the world's most successful companies, executives, and technologies.

One founder who went through the course described it as “one of the most valuable things I’ve done as a CEO.” Overall, YC’s growth program earned an NPS of 70+ from founders, an illustration of the esteem in which it was held.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which made its sudden demise even more startling.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>The last job</h2><p>If there was one source of friction between Anu Hariharan and Y Combinator, one wasp at the picnic, this was it. The accelerator wanted Continuity to invest <em>only </em>in startups that had gone through its early-stage program. Its mission was to prepare YC alumni for the next phase of growth and build greater ownership in their businesses, not accelerate the best growth founders, no matter what their provenance.&nbsp;</p><p>It marked a philosophical difference between Hariharan and her employer. Though she understood that accepting non-YC companies presented a challenge – risking upsetting legacy founders in favor of newcomers, she considered it a surmountable one. “I actually told YC that maybe the program should include companies from the outside. Just like when you look at universities, there are two main entry points: undergraduate and graduate,” said Hariharan.&nbsp;</p><p>YC dabbled with the idea, allowing Continuity to back two external startups: British neobank Monzo and the ill-fated logistics company Convoy. Ultimately, though, it declined to continue the experiment, preferring to exclusively serve alumni.&nbsp;</p><p>Long before Hariharan joined Continuity or even a16z, she’d known that, at some point, she wanted to build a business of her own. “I’ve always had the itch to be an entrepreneur. I didn’t know whether I would start a company or a fund, but I knew that my last job could never be part of any platform.” The limitations on Continuity’s operations, added to the fact that she’d stayed at YC much longer than she’d anticipated, caused Hariharan to consider building something of her own.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of 2022, she’d written a “strategy letter” outlining the fund she planned to start. It would be a firm influenced by the impact of YC Continuity but available to all founders. “I thought that what we built at YC was awesome, and I really wanted to continue that work,” Hariharan explained. “Barring a few, growth investing on the outside is done so poorly. It’s done lazily. Everyone thinks, “Oh, these companies have their Series A, that’s enough. They have $5-15 million in revenue; they don’t need support.’ That’s <em>absolutely</em> not true. I felt there was an opportunity to do this really well, inspired by all the YC principles I learned, but to do it differently.”</p><p>There’s a long-standing joke in the Hariharan family: every financial recession comes for Anu. She graduated college in the wake of the dotcom crash, then received her MBA amidst the wreckage of the global financial crisis. But as America flirted with another downturn at the start of 2023 and Silicon Valley weathered a banking crisis, the Hariharans were uncommonly sanguine. “My family thought, ‘Oh, in 2023, Anu is safe; she has so many years of experience,’” Hariharan says with a chuckle. “And then, of everyone in the family, I was the only one without a job.”&nbsp;</p><p>The defenestration of Hariharan, Rowghani, and the rest of the Continuity team was swift. On March 13, 2023, <em>The Information </em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/y-combinator-to-end-late-stage-startup-continuity-fund?rc=jtsqvx">reported</a> that new YC president Garry Tan had decided to close the firm’s growth practice as part of a push to refocus the accelerator. “Late-stage investing turned out to be so different from early-stage investing that we found it to be a distraction from our core mission,” Tan told <em>The Information</em> at the time.</p><p>It came as a jolt to Hariharan. Though she’d laid the groundwork for a new fund, she hadn’t expected to take the jump until 2024 at the earliest. Now, the transition had been thrust upon her. “It was hard, she said. “We had to take care of the whole team. It was a huge shock to them.” At the time of Tan’s announcement, Continuity still had $500 million in capital left to invest.&nbsp;</p><p>It caught many prominent alumni off-guard, too, with at least ten startups <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/garry-tans-first-big-move-as-y-combinator-ceo-roils-founders?rc=jtsqvx">expressing</a> in a letter to YC that they were “surprised and deeply disappointed” by a decision that impacted the composition of their boards. Signatories included the founders of Brex, Deel, Rappi, Zepto, Convoy, and Monzo.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;30b28a68-435b-4ba1-ac8d-e1a826be769c&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Actionable insights&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rappi: The One Who Knocks&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:9653721,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mario Gabriele&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Founder of The Generalist&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5007322-b272-4faa-9489-8f159a07e65a_1205x1297.jpeg&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:1000}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2021-10-03T12:11:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e1d1cbf-4eec-4813-a906-308cd6f25b74_2700x2100.png&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/rappi-the-one-who-knocks&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:105811971,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:0,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Generalist&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2dfe63cd-67ea-49ba-92df-930520a822a0_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p>Though undoubtedly a blow to Hariharan and her team, it also presented an opportunity. “I had assumed I wasn’t going to take anyone with me from YC, which is why I’d started conversations with Lucas [Fox] ahead of time,” Hariharan said of the recently departed Brex employee. “Now, I could also get Nic [Dardenne] and Tiffany [Kosolcharoen] from day one, which meant there were many steps I could eliminate, and we could spring into action very quickly.”&nbsp;</p><p>By September 2023, seven months after Continuity’s closure, Avra Capital ran its first batch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The Avra academy</h2><p>Almost exactly a year after Avra launched its program, welcoming eleven companies into its cohort, it is wrapping up its third batch. In the intervening 12 months, Avra is reportedly honing in on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/former-yc-continuity-head-targets-350-million-growth-stage-fund/">$350 million</a> in capital, according to TechCrunch (Hariharan declined to comment on the matter). Andrew Davis, Managing Partner of Socium Ventures, shared his rationale for backing Avra’s debut vehicle:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The easiest way to gain conviction in Anu’s track record was by seeing how many of the founders and partners she worked with chose to be investors in [Avra]. I have partnered with Anu for many years, and she is one of the most impactful and ethical investors I’ve ever worked with. We couldn’t say ‘yes’ fast enough when she asked us.</p></blockquote><p>As well as winning over limited partners like Davis, Avra has also honed its curriculum, built intriguing in-house software, and impressed some of the world’s most coveted growth-stage founders. Entrants include European OpenAI challenger Mistral, creative platform Runway ML, GPU orchestration system Foundry, gaming device Backbone, and many others.</p><p>In devising Avra, Hariharan chose to build around a few key pillars – some inspired by YC Continuity, others in direct opposition:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Open to all.</strong> Since Avra is not part of an existing platform, it is free to accept any business it chooses without having to give preferential treatment to YC alumni. Places are given to the growth-stage firms Avra considers most promising.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Founder taught</strong>. Like YC Growth, Avra’s programs are taught by expert practitioners, typically tenured CEOs or VPs with domain expertise. These people have gone through the same challenges as Avra’s students and can speak with experience and authority.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Off-the-record</strong>. Many venture firms produce first-rate content for founders. However, when this information features advice from other entrepreneurs, it is inherently “on-the-record.” By keeping all of Avra’s sessions confidential, instructors are able to speak with greater vulnerability, specificity, and candor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Education-first</strong>. Avra sees itself as an educational offering first and a fund second. This is more than just marketing. The majority of the team’s time and focus is spent on improving its programming and associated offerings. The idea is that investment opportunities will naturally follow.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalized curriculum</strong>. Though growth companies face the same set of challenges – scaling executive teams and maintaining high throughput – they do not all experience them at the same time. Avra tries to ensure its sessions directly attack founders’ most pressing problems, as well as prepare them for the future.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>No strings attached</strong>. Admittance to the program is not predicated on Avra investing, either implicitly or explicitly. Founders understand that Avra monetizes as a venture firm but are not pressured to solicit them for future rounds. Hariharan’s team believes it will earn the opportunity by delivering value, not by making demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>These principles have guided the creation of the Avra apparatus, a machine that ingests thousands of startups but serves a select few. It is neither the slow, precious, boutique venture capital of the traditionalists nor does it adhere to Y Combinator’s industrialized model. It is something new, something in between – a processed, productized approach to small-batch brewing.</p><p>Before exploring its curriculum, it’s important to understand how it sits within Avra’s broader structure and sequencing. In total, its methodology is comprised of 8 critical steps:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg" width="1456" height="1132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1132,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:696378,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb80e284-4a95-42ce-8e90-f584216d4e45_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Step 1: Data-driven sourcing</h3><p>Avra scans tens of thousands of startups around the world through a bespoke early-detection system devised by Tiffany Kosolcharoen. Though it has a similar goal to the product Kosolocharoen built at YC Continuity – identifying breakout startups – it is being architected in a new technological era. “We get to reimagine it in the age of AI,” Kosolcharoen said. “The stack is being reinvented.”</p><p>The early-detection system tracks approximately 50,000 global startups between pre-seed and Series A, excluding Chinese businesses and those in sectors Avra feels unsuited to advise. Though the fund is generalist in approach, it steers clear of a few highly technical, specialized pockets like biotech.&nbsp;</p><p>Kosolcharoen and the broader team are tight-lipped about how exactly the system works but did share some of its key principles and a few example data sources. “There’s this large alternative data industry where hedge funds spend millions of dollars a year to acquire data sets. Through my past experiences, we’ve learned how to do it differently where we’re not spending that amount of money. We’re really looking at which metrics are leading versus lagging in breakout businesses,” Kosolcharoen explained. “For example, revenue might be a lagging indicator because it’s not necessarily the first metric that helps you identify a breakout business. The same is true of job openings – only after a company achieves a certain round of funding are they able to open up new positions.”</p><p>So, what data sources are actually leading? Lucas Fox highlighted the importance of tracking Github repositories and stars, Twitter trends, and engagement via platforms like Discord or other open-source communities. Avra’s system tracks the social activity of certain influential people – noting the new companies or entrepreneurs they follow. It also incorporates app traffic, web traffic, Hacker News upvotes, backlinks growth, and consumer credit card data. The system integrates qualitative signals, too, assessing the perceived quality of a founding team and the caliber of the company’s known cap table. In total, it tracks more than 50 custom sources to develop a sense of the current market.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this process, Avra filters 50,000 startups to a shortlist of a few hundred that it continuously monitors. Further screening relies on manual intervention and nuanced judgment. Kosolcharoen creates “competitive sets” for different industries as part of this process. The idea here is to parse the dynamics within a certain industry to allow for cleaner comparisons between players. “It’s a really controversial, contentious topic because every single person at a company defines their competitive set differently,” Kosolcharoen noted. “It’s about identifying the peer sets today and then going through the game theory to see who might be in that peer set in the future.”&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg" width="1456" height="762" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:762,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:699228,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55abbc5c-cebe-48a4-9b69-214370a1c7db_4725x2473.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The ultimate goal is to use this information to pick potential market winners. “There’s often a human angle to it, some product strategy, to identifying a category leader. You need to figure out which companies might converge onto each other,” Kosolcharoen clarified. “That’s a challenge if you anchor only on alternative data. The product roadmap and product strategy of a company doesn’t exist in a data format. You need a combination of looking at the data and the strategy to identify which companies may be inflecting among their peer set.”&nbsp;</p><p>For example, an analysis of the neobanking space would not only compare Nubank, Revolut, Chime, Monzo, and dozens of other consumer offerings. It would have highlighted the potential for neobrokers like Robinhood and Public to make a play for the space, for B2B offerings like Mercury and Brex to try and win over consumers, for rent rewards-focused cards like Bilt to extend outward, and for stablecoin-based products like DolarApp to win with new rails.&nbsp;</p><p>According to attendees of Avra's program, Kosolcharoen has a gift for this process. “She’s extremely talented at understanding business models,” Joseph Nelson, CEO of Roboflow, said. “When you have tactical questions around positioning, or what’s going on in your space, she can not only talk about it in terms of what makes sense strategically but also what’s playing out in the sector and how you should think about it as a result.”&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the 37 companies that have attended the program so far, it’s evident that Avra’s system has identified non-obvious candidates alongside some of the buzzy names previously mentioned.</p><p>Anu Hariharan cited Clerk.dev as an example of Avra’s quantitative sourcing at work. Its system flagged the user management platform’s spiking sign-ups and encouraged Avra to reach out. In its second batch, Hariharan estimates that Kosolcharoen’s system helped select approximately 60% of the companies. Avra has also invited companies headquartered in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, France, and Sweden – not entrepreneurial backwaters, but some way behind the USA.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg" width="1456" height="1132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1132,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:726270,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F049bc65e-cfa8-4dcd-8068-88d573bc0270_4725x3675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Before it gets to the invitation stage, Avra conducts further filtering. It cannot reasonably meet with hundreds of companies; instead, it watches them over time and looks for inflection points followed by consistent growth. “We do week-over-week monitoring. That’s how we know which ones are taking off,” Hariharan said. “The key is to measure it dynamically. Pretty easily, you get to a top 50 because not everyone is growing week-over-week.”</p><p>Finally, Avra does external diligence to cut its top 50 down to 20 finalists. It conducts further research, speaks to customers, assesses the logos they’ve succeeded in signing up, and asks its community of founders for comment. “Our alums often say, ‘Talk to these people, don’t talk to those ones.’ They help us narrow down the list and also add founders we might have missed,’” Hariharan said. “They’ll say, ‘Hey, this company might not be on your radar because they just raised a seed and haven’t announced it, but they need to be on your list.’”&nbsp;</p><p>These referrals are a critical part of Avra’s sourcing process. Founders are often excellent judges of talent and early adopters of new, disruptive technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Nic Dardenne, Avra is already benefiting from this process. “For our second batch, we were able to get 20-30 recommendations from founders that went through the first batch or had previous relationships with,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Hariharan noted that Anyscale (Avra Batch 2), an AI compute platform, had been referred by RunwayML’s CEO, Cris Valenzuela (Avra Batch 1). Similarly, Clair (Avra Batch 2), the provider of earned wage access solutions, came thanks to a recommendation from Plaid’s Zach Perret (YC Growth). “Clair actually hadn’t come up on our radar because they were just breaking out,” Hariharan said. “Zach said that we should really talk to them.”</p><h3>Step 2: One-on-one evaluations</h3><p>Once Avra has identified 20 finalists, it contacts them for a meeting. Before getting to the meetings themselves and what the fund is looking for, it’s worth highlighting an advantage Avra has in this outreach compared to traditional venture firms.</p><p>Hot companies are constantly warding off investors; garlic, crucifix, and terse email responses at the ready. Any startup the market sees as a potential breakout receives a steady drip of inbound interest, requests for casual coffee chats, and suggestions of pre-emptive financing. Though the first such offers may be flattering, they quickly become distracting, which is why so many CEOs shut them down with a simple: “heads down building, will circle back when we raise next.”</p><p>Because Avra offers a specific, differentiated product, it is able to sidestep this tripwire. When a member of the investment team reaches out to a startup CEO, it is not asking to invest; it is <em>offering </em>something of value. Especially when this pitch comes via a founder who enjoyed the program, it’s a powerful sell.&nbsp;</p><p>During its meetings with founders, Avra seeks to better understand the stage of the company and the capabilities of the founder. Three characteristics are particularly important:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Revenue threshold</strong>. Avra’s program is explicitly designed for growth-stage companies. If a company hasn’t achieved meaningful revenue, it may be better for them to wait for a later batch. “If you haven’t gotten to $2 million in annual revenue, it doesn’t make sense to do the program because it is not a good use of their time,” Hariharan said.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Scaling speed</strong>. As well as surpassing a certain threshold, Avra also looks to ensure a startup is growing rapidly. Much of Avra’s program focuses on building large, performant teams at hyper-speed, something a more modestly growing company may not need. “If you’re not scaling really fast in terms of revenue growth, you shouldnt be scaling your team,” Hariharan added.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>A self-aware CEO.</strong> “I’ve had the privilege of working with a lot of really good founders, and they’re <em>very</em> self-aware,” Hariharan explained. “It’s almost a signal we’re testing for because we don’t want founders who feel like they know everything. It won’t work for us, and over the long term, we have learned it does not work well for the company.” Avra looks for CEOs that understand their strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Is it difficult to gauge self-awareness? Avra seems to find it straightforward, asking a series of questions that force introspection. A few examples:</p><ul><li><p>What’s energizing about your job? What’s draining?</p></li><li><p>What are three things you’re good at? What are three things you suck at?</p></li><li><p>What are the strengths of your leadership team?</p></li><li><p>How well do you think you’ve hired?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>These questions, and others like them, provide a window into how founders have solved problems and their current assessment of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Avra can’t invite every founder it meets with, cutting its 20 finalists down to a 10-12 company batch. So far, almost every company Hariharan has invited has accepted despite the commitment it requires.&nbsp; “The take-up is very high,” Hariharan said. According to Avra’s founder, only one company chose not to attend Batch 1 for timing reasons.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 3: Kick-off retreat</h3><p>To create an environment in which founders feel comfortable sharing their challenges and failures, Avra kicks off each batch with an in-person retreat in Santa Rosa, California. This is a time for attendees to get to know one another and build context on each other’s businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s exceptionally helpful in setting the stage,” Roboflow’s Nelson said. “People share what’s working and not working inside their companies.” Vojta Drmota, CEO of Momence, shared a similar opinion: “You get to know the other founders on a personal level. There is no substitute for understanding who founders are and learning about their journey. That bond is really important for the rest of the program.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:252570,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb40c1c02-dc47-4dfa-ac71-2eabcdb25acc_1600x1067.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Roboflow's founders, Joseph Nelson and Brad Dwyer (Roboflow)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Avra works to build rapport through structured exercises. “It feels kind of like a summer-camp-manufactured-fun kind of vibe,” Joseph Nelson said. “But it actually kind of works and makes you feel more relaxed with your peers. It establishes trust and candor amongst people in the program.”</p><p>Much of the retreat’s value occurs outside these team-building activities. “A big piece of it is just bringing people together,” Nic Dardenne explained. “It gives them a space away from their companies, away from their day-to-day, away from their laptop. It’s just free time to be able to connect.”</p><h3>Step 4: Classes</h3><p>The reason Avra invests in creating rapport between batchmates is because it wants its classes to be discussion groups, not lectures. “A lot of the value comes from founders sharing their problems, not just from the instructors,” Nic Dardenne remarked. “You need it not to be a one-to-many lecture. People have to feel comfortable sharing and being more vulnerable.”</p><p>Avra’s core curriculum is composed of 7 classes. Hariharan has asked that we not name the instructors so that we can share their takeaways while respecting the off-the-record nature of the sessions. These are Avra’s classes, in sequence:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Executive hiring and management (taught by two CEOs)</p></li><li><p>Mission, strategy, and metrics (taught by two CEOs)</p></li><li><p>Leading leaders (taught by public market CEO)</p></li><li><p>Operating cadence (taught by a CEO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Scaling engineering (taught by two CTOs)</p></li><li><p>Scaling people management (taught by a CEO and former VP of People)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Financial Planning and fundraising (taught by a CFO)&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Before each session, students are tasked with “pre-reading,” which usually takes a couple of hours to consume. They may also be prompted to reflect on the topic and tell the Avra team what they’re particularly keen to learn about, creating a more tailored program. Lucas Fox gave an example of how this works. “Ahead of our ‘Leading leaders’ session in Batch 2, we spent five minutes with each founder ahead of time really understanding the number one bottlenecks each of them had as it relates to people management. Out of 12 CEOs, we got 12 pressing problems. And then, on the call with the instructor, we just went one by one, asking, ‘How would you tackle this? How would you think about this?’ It’s very tactical. It’s not a general talk.”</p><p>The sessions themselves last approximately 90 minutes. Hariharan plays the role of interlocutor for instructors, prompting them to talk about certain experiences, share certain frameworks, or respond to questions. Her expertise is obvious in this role. It’s clear not only that she knows the stories of the instructors’ companies intimately, able to perfectly poke and prod, but that she also understands what is likely to be most valuable to growth-stage startups. As teachers share their experiences, students frequently chime in with questions or comments of their own. Magical moments occur when multiple CEOs – both those in the program and those teaching it – weigh in on a given subject, explaining how their company handles executive compensation or engineering structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul Copplestone, CEO of Supabase, highlighted the value of the discussions. “It’s super useful. And Anu is very good at prodding the instructors further. ‘What were the mistakes you made at this stage? Who did you hire? How many hours did you spend with executive recruits? What was your process?’ Anu’s constantly pulling them back to our stage – and maybe one step ahead. These topics are pretty timeless. There are all sorts of little tricks that founders have learned over the years. This is a way for them to pass that knowledge along.”</p><p>For RunwayML’s Cris Valenzuela, the value of the sessions was less in picking up specific tips and more in hearing the thinking process of exceptional CEOs. “I’m less a fan of instructions and recipes and rules that you can follow,” he said. “I’m more interested in intuition and how people make decisions. You can learn a lot by hearing how successful companies have been built and the decisions people took along the way. That’s the exposure I wanted. It wasn’t about getting something particular out of it, more of a way of thinking about how to tackle specific problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>Going through the experience together is another critical part of its value. “The reason the CEO job feels so lonely is because you’re grappling with things you’ve never dealt with before,” Hex founder Barry McCardel explained. “One of the few salves for it is knowing that the problems you’re facing are very common. When you go through a program like this, you get to talk to folks who are a few phases ahead and went through the same things you’re going through. You get to talk to other founders who have the same thoughts as you do. And they reaffirm for you that, yes, it is hard. And no, you’re not an idiot for struggling with it. It’s really helpful. It gets you out of your head and lets you zero in on the task at hand.”</p><h3>Step 5: Office hours</h3><p>In tandem with classes, Avra offers weekly office hours. These are an opportunity for founders to reflect on recent sessions and talk through their particular problems in greater detail.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re super useful,” Paul Copplestone said, citing their impact on leveling up Supabase’s financials as part of Avra’s push for the company to create a “mini S-1” (more in a moment). “The mini S-1 project makes you think a lot and forces you to ask a lot of questions. Without the office hours, I would have been floundering a bit, especially around knowing how to write up our financials. The Avra team literally built spreadsheets for us, which I now use for our investors.”</p><p>Momence CEO Vojta Drmota also found the added attention of office hours valuable. “In between sessions we would meet with Anu and her team. It supplemented the sessions very well because it was more pointed toward where Momence is now and what we need to focus on.”</p><p>For Avra as an investor, office hours are another chance to diligence companies close up. Founders openly talk about their thorniest problems and discuss how they’re thinking about solving them. Avra then gets to observe how quickly and effectively they test different solutions and land on the correct answer. Though most growth VCs get to know potential investments over a long period of time (at least six months and usually a year) to create a longitudinal view of their progress, Avra gets to witness it up close and unvarnished.</p><p>Hariharan highlighted how valuable it is to see founders address problems in real time. “How fast you move is very important. How long is a founder sitting on a certain decision? Do they have tight feedback loops, and are they course-correcting quickly? What frameworks are they using? Do they get stuck by brick walls, or do they know how to run through them?”</p><h3>Step 6: Mini S-1</h3><p>Avra’s batch culminates with an exercise: writing a “mini” S-1 filing. The goal is for founders to understand how their business fits into the broader corporate landscape, learn how public market investors value comparable companies, reflect on the core drivers of their current success, and sketch a blueprint for life as a public business.&nbsp;</p><p>Vojta Drmota outlined the process and its value. “It teaches you to present your business in a structured fashion. That’s something you don’t do as a private company on a regular basis. You write investor updates, but this is a much more detailed format. That’s very helpful, in and of itself,” he said. “Another key part of it is that in the S-1, you have to explain to an investor the $10 billion, $50 billion, or $100 billion outcome. You have to indicate where the company can go to impress upon investors that it’s a worthy investment. That’s not something you really think about as a founder. You think about, ‘How do I get to the $15 million revenue mark? How do I get to the $25 million mark?’ You rarely think about how you get to $5 billion or $10 billion.”&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking in those terms forces a level of bottom-up analysis that many startups don’t prioritize early in their lives. “You have to articulate what the best case scenario for your TAM is, what your market share has to look like, and what ACVs have to look like,” Drmota said. “It forces you to think not just about your mission but how it can be materialized.”&nbsp;</p><p>Founders rely on help from Avra and feedback from their batchmates to craft their S-1, which they eventually present in front of prominent public market investors. “It’s definitely an interesting process,” Cris Valenzuela said. “You learn a lot just by doing it, but you also get a lot because you speak with other people about it and get feedback. It helps you understand the future things you should be thinking about. I’d never done it before.”&nbsp;</p><p>Anu Hariharan consistently and earnestly emphasizes that office hours and the mini S-1 exercise are done to serve founders. There is no doubting the sincerity of that suggestion. The pragmatists among you cannot help but notice the advantages these exercises grant Avra the investor. From that vantage, the S-1 exercise asks founders to diligence themselves, presenting their findings and future growth for review. In essence, they are creating a pitch – stuffed with detail, risks, and opportunities. This exercise would not work if founders didn’t find it valuable; a happy byproduct is that it doubles as investment research.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 7: Private wiki</h3><p>If a YC alum needs a question answered, there’s a good chance they’ll post on Bookface. That’s the name for the accelerator’s private site featuring a discussion forum, investor ratings, a library of resources, and various perks.&nbsp;</p><p>Avra is building its own version of that resource, designed for growth-stage entrepreneurs. For now, the private wiki is barebones but already intriguing. It features a directory of the 42 founders who have attended Avra’s program, access to a private off-the-record podcast, and a wiki that documents key lessons from across the curriculum. Visit the page for “Leading leaders,” for example, and you’ll find well-structured notes gleaned from the associated session. Over time, Avra plans to add to these pages, creating a repository of high-quality information that helps founders during the program and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s exciting to envision what form this might take. As well as incorporating expertise from multiple CEOs over time in a given page, Avra could also collect collateral from different entrepreneurs. Sometimes, simply seeing how a founder lays out their hiring process on the page, or builds their board deck, can make a tangible difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Roboflow’s Nelson hopes Avra facilitates more of this resource sharing. “I think there are probably ways to grease the wheels and make sharing resources more commonplace. For example, making companies more comfortable walking through recent board decks and trading ideas. You can only do that when you have a close relationship.”&nbsp;</p><p>As the trusted connection between its instructors and students, Avra is positioned to act as the hub for this information. In time, growth-stage founders may want to join Hariharan’s community as much to access this library as to attend its course.</p><h3>Step 8: Alumni sessions&nbsp;</h3><p>Though Avra’s program culminates with the mini S-1 exercise, the firm’s relationship with founders continues beyond it. As well as continually adding new resources to its wiki, Avra holds alumni sessions and an off-the-record podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no real difference between these two products. Both feature Hariharan holding a conversation with a prominent founder, operator, or technologist, using her expert prodding to deftly direct the discussion. Past sessions have given founders an opportunity to learn about AI from a long-time expert, hear about a remarkable public market turnaround, and discover how an external CEO rescued a flagging unicorn from collapse. The idea of the podcast is to inspire founders during their most difficult times.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1367294,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89ae9b7-10f3-4bd6-a188-4665f4227925_2880x2160.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Avra's alumni sessions can be used to address episodic challenges, like the shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Alumni sessions are an effective way for Avra to augment founders’ education and address transient issues. For example, had Avra existed during the Silicon Valley Bank catastrophe, it would have been well-positioned to put together a rapid response session, pulling in experts from relevant fields. As funding ebbs and flows and disruptive technologies like AI change the game on the field, this ongoing education is extremely valuable.&nbsp;</p><h2>Class is in session</h2><p>The hours I spent with Avra’s curriculum were among my highest-leverage of the year. In the course of a cumulative 12 hours, I learned how some of the world’s best CEOs manage their recruiting, financials, engineering teams, and fundraises. I heard of common mistakes, near-death experiences, and miraculous turnarounds.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which is why I’m extremely excited that Avra has allowed The Generalist to share takeaways from the program. To be clear, these are just the tip of the iceberg. Each session is packed with fascinating insights – some obvious in their value, others more subtle.&nbsp;</p><p>When Hariharan pitches the program to founders, she tells them they will receive direction in three areas:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Executive hiring and management</p></li><li><p>Shipping fast as you scale</p></li><li><p>Execution and clarity of thought</p></li></ol><p>Rather than walk through all seven sessions, we’ve distilled impactful pieces of advice from the entire curriculum that fit those categories.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, to respect the confidentiality of the instructors, we’ve kept them anonymous and stayed clear of identifying information. We’ve highlighted universal takeaways that stand alone and that we believe will be of greatest use to other founders.</p><h3>Focus 1: Executive hiring and management</h3><p>To scale your company, you must learn to hire exceptional people with capabilities that surpass your own in at least one dimension. Though founders are used to pinch-hitting across functions in a startup’s early days, winning in the growth phase necessitates finding and converting executives who can take your company to the next step.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Executive hiring success rate.</strong> A surprisingly large number of executive hires do not work out. Hex founder Barry McCardel cited this as particularly valuable information. “People will tell you that a good success rate for leadership hires is 60-70%. In reality, it’s closer to 50% for most companies, which is insane when you think about it. Hearing from other CEOs who are further along in their journey [was really helpful.]” Great executives surpass these levels. One CEO said that their last <em>15</em> executive hires had all worked out, an “exceptional” record.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t skip the references</strong>. It’s easy to skip out on referring executive hires earlier in your company’s life. Often, you might think you have enough information to make the call yourself. Don’t take this shortcut. One instructor said that 30% of the team references revealed a piece of critical information about a recruit. When you conduct references, ask the reference to score the person out of 10. Anything below a ‘9’ should be considered a poor score.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Take a “breadth-first” approach to the executive search</strong>. A common cause of a failed hire is not knowing the profile of the person you’re recruiting for. To prevent that from happening, conduct a “breadth-first” search in which you speak to different “flavors” of the role you’re hiring for. For example, if you’re recruiting a CFO, talk to one with more of an accounting background, one that’s more FP&amp;A oriented, and one that focuses on strategic finance to see which feels like the best fit. When you find the right person, be aggressive in winning them. “Elite founders don’t lose candidates,” was one CEO’s mantra.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest heavily in executive onboarding</strong>. When you succeed in hiring an executive, give them the tools to succeed. Align on the expectations for the role, and have <em>them</em> devise a plan for their first 30, 60, 90 days. (This is a place where you should lean on their functional expertise.) For the first 30-60 days, encourage them to spend as much time as possible simply learning about the organization rather than managing direct reports or producing work. For example, one incoming CEO conducted <em>80</em> one-on-ones and 20 group meetings before officially taking the reins. This is time well spent.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Proactively give raises to retain talent</strong>. Employees who scale alongside a startup often drastically increase their importance in a short amount of time. To avoid losing these people, give “out of band” pay increases when you notice their salary lags behind their impact. This will prevent them from feeling undervalued and looking for a new role. Additionally, one CEO recommends conducting stock refresher grants around the 2.5-year mark of an employee’s tenure as many consider their next move after about three years.</p></li></ol><h3>Focus 2: Shipping fast as you scale</h3><p>Founders often think their organization will accelerate as headcount increases. After all, can’t you achieve more with more people? It’s more common for the opposite to occur, at least in the short term. As your company scales, old processes break, the quality of new hires degrades, and coordination costs grow. Shipping fast as you scale requires an uncompromising mindset, intense work ethic, and sound strategy.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Don’t accept “CEO in a box” trade-offs</strong>. Internal leaders will often come to you with either/or decisions: <em>you can either have a product built fast or with quality; which do you want?</em> One executive calls these “CEO in a box” trade-offs that should not be accepted. Why can’t a product be delivered quickly and with exceptional quality? It is almost always possible to avoid these false compromises.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>When troubleshooting, look for anecdotal evidence, not data</strong>. When a part of the organization is not working, it’s more useful to dig into transcripts or Slack messages than review high-level numbers. If the support team is lagging, read the last 25 tickets. If sales is underperforming, read the last 25 Gong recordings. You’ll spot patterns and get much deeper context than a dashboard can provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Commit to crazy</strong>. While attending an accelerator like YC, founders are pushed to their limits and operate at a frenzied pace. According to one CEO, when the program ends, most people revert to a much slower cadence. To build a legendary business, you cannot allow yourself to do this. Instead, you should be part of the few “crazy motherfuckers” that maintain that relentless speed. Working 20% more doesn’t yield a 20% productivity increase, according to this CEO; it delivers “way, way more.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Go slow to go fast</strong>. To build engineering teams that ship quickly, spend time upfront on two key areas: data modeling and core technology decisions. Both of these are difficult to change down the line, so think it through before committing. On a related note, consider introducing code reviews and tests from day one or close to it. Both will save you time in the long run and ensure you have strong engineering foundations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Break your engineering team into pods</strong>. As your company scales, you’ll need to manage an increasing number of engineers. Splitting people into arbitrary teams can drastically increase communication and coordination costs, slowing down shipping. One CTO outlines the approach his company uses, organizing itself into small 8-10 person “pods.” Pods are composed of 5-7 engineers, a PM, a designer, and a data scientist. Pods are given the context and resources they need to achieve their goals but are empowered to set their own strategy and to act as “small startups.”</p></li></ol><h3>Focus 3: Execution and clarity of thought</h3><p>In preparation for your Series B, take the time to look toward the future and build the systems you need to achieve your ultimate goals. Startups are constantly faced with urgent issues that require attention. You must proactively <em>make</em> time for non-urgent but still important subjects. In particular, make the effort to define your metrics, hone your messaging, and prepare for future raises.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Separate input and output metrics</strong>. Companies are used to focusing on “output” metrics like revenue or monthly active users (MAUs). Though this information is useful, especially for investors, it’s insufficiently actionable. What do you have to do <em>exactly</em> to grow MAUs? “Input” metrics are KPIs that help drive your output metrics and are more directly within your control. For example, to increase revenue as a food delivery company, you might set input metrics of order frequency and customer retention, as these could make an impact on your topline. Picking the right input metrics will require data analysis and deep consideration, but once you identify them, it’s much easier to direct your team’s efforts effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat your message consistently and frequently</strong>. Creating alignment across the organization requires you to restate your company’s mission, metrics, and strategy much more than you might expect. At least every week, you should re-communicate this to the company, using consistent language. Though it may seem like overkill, it’s critical to maintaining a common goal, refocusing different teams, and getting new hires up to speed.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Financial planning by confidence interval</strong>. As your company matures, building out a strategic financial department becomes essential. You will need a Head of Finance and, eventually, a CFO who can help you set realistic projections and plan for the future. Though setting goals often begins top-down, with a CEO outlining their ambitions, it should gradually become more bottom-up as the team scales and your processes become more predictable. Nevertheless, making perfect projections can be difficult for an organization that develops rapidly. One strategy is to plan for whatever period you have 70% confidence you can accurately forecast. This might be three months, six months, or a year. While this shouldn’t replace your annual planning, it ensures your forecasts don’t drift too out of line.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Lay the groundwork with investors</strong>. Growth-stage investors are writing larger checks, typically in the $20-100 million range. As a result, their process is longer and more detailed. To ensure you fundraise from a position of strength, identify 5-10 investors you believe would be suited to lead your next round and begin building relationships with them 6-12 months ahead of when you plan to raise. This gives VCs the opportunity to get to know you better, learn more about your model and market, and arrive to the fundraise with a prepared mind. It also allows you to vet potential partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Running a tight fundraise</strong>. If poorly managed, raising capital can take months or longer. You should drive investors to follow a 1-4 week diligence process. For that to happen, you must arrive prepared and equipped with a well-stocked data room. Once the process has begun, you should focus your attention on “high-signal investors” – namely, those that actually seem interested in your business. A good rule of thumb: “An interested investor tries to speed you up rather than slow you down.” When possible, use the momentum of other VCs to drive peers through the process.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Aberrant venture</h2><p>Venture capital, all of its theater and competition, can be condensed into six essential tasks:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Sourcing</strong>. To invest in a legendary company, you must find it first. Sourcing is the art of discovering as many high-quality opportunities as possible, ideally before your rivals.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Assessing</strong>. Once you’ve identified a potential investment, you must spend time diligencing it. At the growth stage, this often occurs over months or years of conversations and formal research.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Winning</strong>. Just because you have conviction in a startup does not mean you get to invest in it. Venture capitalists have to convince founders to <em>let</em> them buy shares, often over competitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investing</strong>. Though usually winning a deal results in an investment being made, they are theoretically distinct steps. Because of Avra’s model, and its quirks, it’s worth separating them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supporting</strong>. Not all VC firms want to help their portfolio companies, with some believing it to be a folly. Most do, however, assist with hiring, business development, future financing, and much more. This is the “adding value” phase that VCs market to the point of parody.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Exiting</strong>. To realize a return on an investment, VCs have to exit their position at some point. This may occur as a company enters the public markets, via an M&amp;A event, or through secondary sales.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Not only do these six tasks neatly summarize the work of a venture capitalist, but they also describe the sequence in which this style of investing occurs. Though there’s frequent overlap between them, each more or less operates as a distinct step in the process: you find a business, evaluate it, win it, “work” it, and sell it. It’s chronological and sequential.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects of Avra’s model is that it <em>rearranges</em> these steps to its own benefit. Though Avra starts by sourcing companies, it follows that stage by assessing, winning, and supporting a startup all at the same time. Its program compresses these three steps into one: Avra assesses a company as it adds value and, in doing so, preemptively wins the right to invest. Avra follows this process with all of its companies, including many it will not invest in. Only later on does it actually circle back and deploy capital.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg" width="1456" height="1123" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1123,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:785908,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3747d55-7f15-475b-a627-2f64bf2fcd3d_4725x3645.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s a meaningful twist on the venture model. Though investors and founders spend time getting to know one another and learning about each other’s businesses, there’s an unavoidable leap of faith made when entering into a partnership. A blustering dealmaker may spend months telling a CEO how they’ll win them customers, drive candidates to their doors, and broker introductions, only to disappear once the ink has dried. Another financier may extoll the virtues of an expansive in-house team and sophisticated software stack, open only to portfolio companies, and leave the entrepreneur with ineffectual help and vaporware.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Avra proactively frontloads its value-add, founders don’t have to worry about a bait-and-switch. Hariharan’s firm does not <em>tell </em>you how it can help; it <em>shows </em>you in vivid detail. When it comes to partnering, the leap of faith has been shortened into a puddle jump.&nbsp;</p><p>Several of the founders we spoke with expressed their interest in taking money from Avra despite the fact they were not actively fundraising. This is especially notable given that Hariharan’s firm works with many of the ecosystem’s hottest startups who have an abundance of funding options. “If we end up doing a round, I’ll definitely reach out to them,” Supabase’s Paul Copplestone said. “The most helpful and best investor in terms of helpfulness is definitely YC. I’d put Avra right next to them,” he added. “We’re not in a fundraising situation right now, so it’s hard to say, but I don’t see a reason why we wouldn’t reach out to them,” said Vojta Drmota. “I think it would be a strong yes.”</p><p>No venture investor can win every deal they want, of course, and though Avra has unique weapons, it also has weaknesses. “There are upsides and downsides of a new fund,” Joseph Nelson said. “One of the downsides is that a lot of the value for a fund is driving market awareness, whether that’s companies or candidates. That’s something I’m sure Avra is aware of. It’s just like a startup – you just have to offer to ensure you win a customer’s business.”&nbsp;</p><p>The early indications suggest that Avra’s product is doing a good job of winning founders’ business. So far, Hariharan has backed two companies, Zepto and Supabase, which <em>did </em>circle back to Avra a few months after our interview. Interestingly, Zepto is not a graduate of Avra’s program but a breakout business that YC Continuity previously backed. The fact that Avra participated in the grocery delivery company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/20/zepto-a-10-minute-delivery-app-raises-665-million-at-3-6-billion-valuation/">$665 million</a> Series F round illustrates its ability to be flexible and pragmatic, investing in the best opportunities for which it has a prepared mind.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp" width="1456" height="846" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:846,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:476058,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb583e8b4-c4a2-4e0d-8b6a-26dedf5e3498_2400x1395.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Avra invested in Zepto, a fast-commerce company in India (TechCrunch)</figcaption></figure></div><p>It also hints at a remaining opportunity Hariharan and her team intend to address: pre-IPO businesses. Just as growth-stage founders need dedicated help, Avra is convinced that CEOs heading for the public markets could benefit from tailored tutelage.&nbsp;</p><p>“The culmination of a great journey is becoming a public company,” Lucas Fox said. “There’s a reason the vast majority of the Fortune 500 is public – it comes with operational rigor, and there’s a lot of beauty and elegance in being a high-performing public business. We want to be able to partner with founders from the moment they start scaling through to the public markets.”</p><p>It would be a shrewd addition. For even exceptional startup founders, entering the public markets is a learning moment. It requires education and preparation, as well as the embrace of new rules and norms. Fox outlined what this program might look like: “We’ll invite companies that are 1-2 years from being public, and invite them to do a smaller program, probably on the weekends. We have alumni from the program that have already taken their companies public who can teach. We’ll separate it into certain modules, just like the current Avra program designed to help founders avoid common mistakes. It might talk about how to pick the right investment bank, structure your audited financials, or tell your story.”&nbsp;</p><p>By assisting founders at this stage, Avra would once again get a front-row seat to analyze them and could win the opportunity to invest ahead of a public debut. It’s an intriguing position in the capital stack, as there’s relatively little risk, often notable upside, and a much shorter path to liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p>Crucially, it also strengthens Avra’s existing machine. At the moment, much of the fund’s success depends on its goodwill with talented founders willing to teach its sessions. Without these exceptional instructors, it might struggle to attract high-quality growth-stage entrepreneurs to attend its program. Though Hariharan can relay stories and frameworks second-hand, it is more powerful for CEOs to learn directly from one another. By introducing a pre-IPO program, Avra could expressly “reward” those who teach its growth-stage program. Though these are not purely transactional relationships, having a tangible way of returning the favor and deepening the connection between Avra and this critical stakeholder fortifies its approach. “It would tie into the whole ecosystem,” Fox said. “We want to find a way to add value to our teachers as well. We do that one-off right now by introducing them to key people, but we want a systematic playbook to funnel these guests into so that they feel like they’re part of the program, too.”</p><div><hr></div><p>Running a high-growth startup is a job for which there is no real training. It might help if you’ve already built a career for yourself, but it can just as easily work against you. It’s a bonus if you can code, but certainly not a prerequisite. Have you finished your module on self-reliance? How about your symposium on irrational hubris and unhealthy tenacity? From which institution did you receive your Master’s in resourcefulness? Which PhD program granted your doctorate in pain tolerance?&nbsp;</p><p>To build a business is a lonely, bruising job; to do so while having your foot glued to the gas pedal ratchets up the stress and risk to the mix.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the closure of YC Continuity, Avra has emerged as the only serious school for the tiny subset of people building rapidly scaling businesses. Its existence is a benefit to the startup ecosystem and an illustration of the innovation still possible in venture capital. Amongst predictions of a great culling in the asset class’s ranks, Avra shows that new funds are viable, and new approaches can – with enough originality and distinctive value – become increasingly essential. The secret may be to operate as little like a venture firm as possible.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><em>The Generalist’s work is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.

Ilgą laiką taip darau. Tačiau šį kartą prie manęs priėjo kasininkė ir paklausė:</p><p>– Kodėl neįmušėte plastikinio maišelio?<br>– Čia žinokit aš savo iš namų atsinešiau.<br>– Tikrai?<br>– Taip tikrai, galit patikrinti dar smirda levandų oro gaivikliu. Aš visus maišelius taip pasižymiu, – čia vienas iš retų atvejų, kai sugebėjau atsikirsti. Nes tokiuose situacijose dažniausiai būna “žadėjau sakyti”. Tai yra tyliu kaip liurbis, tada po trijų dienų permąstymo sugalvoju, ką būčiau sakęs. Ir kai draugams pasakoju istorija, žinoma, ten būna tas per tris dienas išmąstytas atsikirtimas.</p><p></p><p>Mane paleido. Iš pradžių galvojau, kad kasininkė durna. Juk galėjo peržiūrėti filmuotą medžiagą ir mane pagauti. Bet grįžęs namo supratau, kad čia kasininkė nėra durna. Ją sistema pasiuntė manęs įspėti. </p><p>Esu girdėjęs, kad anksčiau įspėjimas būdavo, kad grįžęs namie klozete rasdavai cigaretės biką, nors bute niekas nerūko. Tipo, saugumas tave stebi, neuždavinėk keistų klausimų. Dabar viskas per plastikinį maišelį.</p><p>Man plastikinis maišelis yra galimybė kažką palikti po savęs. Mano tekstai ir mano humoras tikrai nepergyvens pievoje išmesto plastikinio maišelio. Negaliu sukurti šedevro, užtat galiu palikti plastikinį maišelį. Pastarasis šimtmečius šnarės pievoje. Kaip skulptūra. Kaip menas.</p><p>JIE žino, kaip man svarbu plastikiniai maišeliai, todėl ir nusprendė būtent taip pašiurpinti.</p><p>Žinoma, buvo momentas kuomet galvojau, kad man su galva negerai ir aš čia viską išsigalvoju. Bet atidžiau apžiūrėjus savo butą. Jame viskas pakeista identiškais baldais. Net sienos perdažytos identiška spalva. Prieš kelias dienas buvo atėjęs draugas su nauju fotoaparatu. Labai aukštos kokybės. Atsidariau nuotrauką ir sulyginau virtuvės sieną su esama ir nuotraukoje. Nepatikėsite – viskas identiškai, kiekvienas įbrėžimas atitaikytas. Kam JIEMS taip daryt? Kada JIE spėjo? Kiek JIEMS tai kainavo?</p><p>O aš po tiltu pasakiau, tik tai ką perskaičiau vienoje knygoje: Yra tiesioginė priklausomybė tarp to kiek parduodama ledų ir to kiek žmonių nuskęsta ežeruose ir jūrose. Vos tik Lietuvoje pradeda kilti valgomųjų ledų pardavimai, lyg iš gausybės rago pasipila žmonių skendimai. </p><p>Ledų industrijai tai yra skaudi tiesa, kurią jie bando nuslėpti. Aš tik noriu priminti Valdo Skymantevičiaus dingimo istoriją. Nėra žinoma, nei kas, nei kaip. Tačiau užtenka pagalvoti savo galva. </p><p>Valdas turėjo startupą. Jis su savo komanda buvo pastebėjęs, kad labai daug intravertų perka ledų vien tam, kad jeigu pakeliui sutiktų pažįstamų, jiems galėtų atsakyti:</p><p>– Soriukas, turiu varyt, nes tirpsta ledai.</p><p>Nors tų ledų intravertai net nevalgydavo. Valdas čia pamatė nišą ir sukūrė išlankstomą dėžutę, kuri atrodo kaip ledų pakuotė. Intravertai, nusipirkę tokią lengvai išlankstomą dėžutę, visuomet reikalui esant gali turėti pretekstą išvengti nepatogaus, kad ir labai mažo pokalbio. Jis ten turėjo labai skambų šūkį:</p><p>“Kam pirkti ledus ir juos išmesti kai gali nusipirkti dėžutę, ją patogiai nešiotis, o reikalui esant išsilankstyti”.</p><p>Jeigu su Valdu susidorojo dėl tokio menko startupo. Kodėl su manimi neturėtų susidoroti? Ypač po to, kai tokią skaudžia tiesą pasakiau prieš septynių žmonių minią. Nemaloniausia šioje istorijoje, kad visi tie septyni žmonės yra mano šeimos nariai. Vadinasi, negailestingai ledų industrijai, dirba kažkas iš mano šeimos. Tai tarsi dūris peiliu į nugarą.</p><p>Bet žinote, mylimi skaitytojai ir skaitytojos, man nebaisūs nei nykštukai, nei tirpukai, nei kar kar ar tuo labiau karališki. Man svarbu yra tiesa ir aš ją jums toliau skleisiu.

But if the boss says you need to complete a task, stay back or work weekends, can you say no? Nope. You think you can but you can’t.</p><p>Say no a few times and you’ll mysteriously get laid off. Or forced out. Go on, try it. I f*cking dare you. I did.</p><p>The truth is jobs are modern slavery.</p><p>The good news is the economy is changing. Instead of always-there-to-work we’re moving to just-in-time-workers.</p><p>This shift is creating the massive trend of one-person businesses – consultants, freelancers, coaches, contractors, etc. Instead of one employer you have multiple. Each employer is a customer of your business.</p><p>In my experience working as both an employee and as a one-person business, I’ve learned one thing:</p><p>You can’t count on a boss or employer anymore.</p><h1>Building a business gives you real freedom</h1><p>The employee life made me think I was free.</p><p>But my calendar was full of meetings that I had to attend. When you get into business you <em>actually</em> control your calendar. Like, for real. Appointments only exist if you let them.</p><p>This is a subtle difference but it let’s you design your life how you want.</p><p>Yes, starting a business is scary. What’s ya point? You can lean into the uncomfortable task of starting a business or hide from it and work for someone else’s. But you can’t hide forever. One day regrets will bite you on the butt.</p><p>As my friend Dan Go said:</p><blockquote><p>It was worth trading my personal training job for one year of building an online empire on X to live a lifetime of freedom and make 7-figures a year.</p></blockquote><p>Starting a business is hard but not being free is, too. Choose your hard. Short-term pain or forever pain that’s irreversible.</p><h1>Starting a business lets you chase your f*cking obsession</h1><p>Starting a business is the same as going to the gym every day, lying down on the bench press, and lifting the most weight you can. It hurts but it gets your juices flowing. And you get the post-workout feel-good endorphins.</p><p>What isn’t obvious is business is just a vehicle for obsession.</p><p>You must be obsessed to start a business and keep going long enough to get traction. That’s why businesses built solely for money, or ones that are tied to a hobby/passion/interest fail miserably and destroy people.</p><p>Business is intense. Obsession is the only path to give you the right intensity.</p><p>Everyone should chase obsession at least once in their lives. One year of business obsession can change your life forever.</p><p>Starting a business is building your own world. You create the laws. You set the mission. It becomes a movement that is all-consuming and draws people in like a tornado they can’t escape.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>A pattern I've noticed in successful people:</p><p>They’re obsessed.</p></div><h1>Answer to no one (forever)</h1><p>Being told what to do is annoying.</p><p>My last boss was like a fly on my back. He kept buzzing up my nose every few seconds. The guy couldn’t relax. My work email was full of other people’s commitments and priorities. But all I wanted to do was write online.</p><p>What changed my life was when I quit bosses forever.</p><p>None of them knew what was best when it came to business, anyway. And they sure as hell didn’t know what was best for me and my young family.</p><p>Some people are so brainwashed they think their employer can tell them not to post stuff on social media. So they have their free speech right taken away.</p><p>It’s only when you talk with a lawyer and they laugh loudly that you realize a so-called “social media policy” is what we call in Australia “Trying sh*t on to see if it sticks.”</p><p>Classic example: my second-last bank employer said if I quit, I couldn’t work in banking again for 5 years. LOL. Okay Mr Bank. Sure.</p><p>Soon as I quit I got another job in banking THE NEXT DAY. They didn’t sue me. And if they did they would lose. Because, you know, we’re free to leave employers whenever.</p><pre><code>The rules aren’t the rules.</code></pre><p>They are often guidelines that the sheep follow who never question anything. I question every freaking thing, and most of the time what I find is “policies” are bulsh*t and they’re created by controlling morons.</p><p>Stop answering to other people. Exit the corporate daycare and leave the toddlers to fight over the next product update that’ll disappoint the market like it always does.</p><p>Being told what to do is a virus. It’s better to build a business and figure out what you want to do in life, without all the political games and permission slips.</p><h1>Worst thing that happens is it fails. Best thing is you make a living.</h1><p>What are you so afraid of?</p><p>If everything I’ve said is wrong and I get you fired because you share a puppy photo from the weekend on your LinkedIn, <em>what’s the worst that can happen?</em></p><p>People hold onto jobs like they hold onto 3 year old toddlers who want to walk up and pat a crocodile.</p><p>You can always get another job. </p><p>The world is overflowing with jobs. They’re out of fashion. They’re time has expired. The lack of freedom is making them the worst option.</p><p>If you start a business and it fails you go right back to a job. No worries, mate. But consider the other side. If it works then you make a living by yourself without the nanny police and silly HR policies.</p><p>There’s literally no downside.</p><p>Plus, starting a business will teach you more than a degree or endless online courses ever will. The wisdom is in the action. It’s in taking a calculated risk. It’s in backing yourself. It’s in running a business, not being a faceless line item in someone else’s.</p><h1>Just start a business</h1><p>Start a business because it’s fun. Start a business because you’ve been thinking about it for too long. Start a business because you stand for something. Start a business so you can chase your obsession and work on what you truly believe in.</p><p>I promise, it’s the best decision you’ll ever make.</p><div><hr></div><p>I send this email weekly.

It’s really about how a grey market psychedelic culture is taking off in California, even though these substances are not even decriminalized (yet). People are wilding out—selling shrooms online, holding psychedelic events out in the open, and even inviting journalists like me to write about them. There’s a veneer of legitimacy around all of these happenings; the shroom gummies at the yoga class looked like they belonged on a shelf in Erewhon. But what are the real implications and risks? I talked to underground entrepreneurs, psychedelic therapists, business consultants, and even an ethicist to get to the bottom of it. </p><p>Since the article is currently behind the LAT paywall, I’m sharing a short excerpt with ya’ll below. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png" width="1456" height="1885" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1885,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1569766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc27844-1c4e-4d2b-b6e1-590f61160638_1545x2000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Also, next Monday,  I will be in conversation with <em>New Yorker</em> writer Emily Witt at Skylight bookstore in LA.

In the lobby, shelves displayed serums, candles and natural deodorants next to black boxes filled with magic mushroom gummies. A greeter ushered attendees into a dark windowless room with yoga mats on the carpeted floor, asking each person: “Would you like some mushroom tea?”</p><p>They were there for a yoga class hosted by Personalized Wellbeing, a Los Angeles-based company that provides a range of wellness-based services that support psychedelic experiences. The mushrooms were provided by Psilouette, a brand under the Personalized Wellbeing umbrella with a line of gummies, teas and cacao butter squares containing magic mushrooms. Psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, remains illegal federally and in the state of California. But in Los Angeles’ growing illicit market, Personalized Wellbeing and Psilouette are notable for their sleek branding and brazenness. Tickets to the mushrooms-enhanced yoga class were offered online for <a href="https://archive.is/o/P8TEi/https://personalizedwellbeing.org/collections/microdose-gummies-1/products/assisted-movement-meditation-with-dr-bianca-hur-psyd">$100 per person</a>, and a publicist for the company invited journalists to cover the event, two of whom were in attendance.</p><p>“I thought I was the only person who likes doing drugs while doing yoga, but it’s a <em>thing</em>,” joked Personal Wellbeing founder Derek Chase, who walked around the studio bare-chested with a tumble of blond hair dusting his shoulders. Once everyone was at their mats, staff members began distributing gummies to guests.</p><p>The class is part of an occasional series that Personalized Wellbeing offers to the 25,000 people on its email list, according to Chase. Although the class is private, the company sells mushroom gummies and other products on the Psilouette website, and claims to ship worldwide. They’re not alone in the wellness community, as substances like psilocybin and LSD become increasingly mainstream, destigmatized and easier to access, wellness enthusiasts have begun incorporating them into their self-care routines.</p><blockquote><p><em>“I thought I was the only person who likes doing drugs while doing yoga, but it’s a thing.”</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>— Derek Chase, founder of Personalized Wellbeing</strong></p><p>Personalized Wellbeing’s shroom yoga class is part of a broader trend of psychedelic-enhanced experiences catering to the curious and health-conscious; in Colorado, where psilocybin has been decriminalized at the state level, wellness center 4 Winds Farm offers psychedelic retreats for women. In the 2020 Netflix docu-series “The Goop Lab,” staffers from Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness company went on a retreat in Jamaica to eat, pray and drink mushroom tea. It’s not uncommon to see the cryptic phrase “gummy optional” when signing up for a <a href="https://archive.is/o/P8TEi/https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/list/best-soundbaths-los-angeles">sound bath</a> in certain parts of Los Angeles.</p><p>“We’re going to start to see [similar] events sprout up because the results are really effective,” said Chase in a phone call before Personalized Wellbeing’s yoga class. “I think people are losing the fear [of psychedelics] and are looking for ways to experience the products.”</p><p>But are companies like Personalized Wellbeing putting themselves and their customers at risk by acting as if magic mushrooms are legal? In recent years, California lawmakers’ attempts to legalize psychedelics have <a href="https://archive.is/o/P8TEi/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-16/psychedelics-law-fails-again">repeatedly failed</a>. In August, the FDA also rejected Lykos Therapeutics’ proposal to legalize MDMA-assisted therapy, citing concerns over clinical trial designs. The decision sent shock waves through the psychedelic industry, suggesting substances might not be legalized for the masses as soon as a growing number of companies and investors in the space would like.</p><p>Nevertheless, consumer demand for psychedelic experiences remains, and players in an illegal market who were once cautiously discreet are becoming bolder… </p><div><hr></div><h2>📝 TRIP REPORT</h2><p>Behind an unmarked door on Sunset Boulevard in Echo Park, a secret is hidden in plain sight. Peering through frosted glass behind a pulled-down grate, you might spot two handsome doctors playing Steve Roach’s ambient electronica as they inject ketamine into people’s arms. <a href="https://www.losangelescommunityketamineclinic.com/">Los Angeles Community Ketamine Clinic</a> pops up once a month in an acupuncture studio, and relies entirely on word-of-mouth. While most luxury clinics cost thousands of dollars, LACKC does group sessions for up to three people at a time, which allows them to offer their services for around $200 a pop. </p><p>“It’s sort of an anarchist art project,” said co-founder Matt Baldwin, a psychedelic therapist who used to play in punk bands and has released <a href="https://leavingrecords.com/show-invisibles-or-how-to-make-a-tape-loop">squiggly tape machine</a> music on Leaving Records. When he learned that I was a music journalist, Matt even stopped by my apartment to drop off a zine he’d made about music for psychedelic therapy. </p><p>In addition to making ketamine therapy more affordable, providing an actually-good psychedelic soundtrack is the emphasis of LACKC, and both Matt and his business partner Mark Shortt are adamant that music itself is the medicine—the psychedelics just open you up to it. </p><p>My previous experiences with ketamine therapy have been <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/at-home-ketamine/">underwhelming</a>, and there was one journey in particular that I almost ended early because the New-Age-into-dad-rock music was so cringe. So when a prick in my arm and the smell of an alcohol swab signaled the beginning of my trip, I was relieved to hear Steve Roach’s <em>Structures from Silence</em>, and Don Slepian’s “Sea of Bliss” through the headphones I’d been provided with as aI sank into an other-space that felt like the backstage green room of reality. “The music is so… good…” I croaked, pulling the blindfolds off my face and gazing around the room still cross-eyed. Later, Matt told me that he’d curated the playlist purposely to soothe the fear I’d expressed about “jumping off the cliff of consciousness.” </p><p>Increasingly, researchers and facilitators are paying attention to the role of music in psychedelic therapy. In the same way that music that resonates with your tastes can be the key to a profound experience, <a href="https://www.ecstaticintegration.org/p/music-is-the-medicine">experiments have shown</a> that bad music can also trigger a difficult trip. I’m excited that more musicians are exploring the possibilities of making music for psychedelic therapy, and that ketamine clinics like LACKC are making these services more accessible and appealing to the creative class. If you have some cash to spare, I recommend checking them out… you probably already know you love listening to ambient on ketamine, but doing this in therapeutic setting—where there are literal doctors checking your vitals and giving you blankets lol—feels so much safer than a chaotic club environment. Why not try going deep? </p><h2>💊 THE SCOOP</h2><ul><li><p>This is an insane story of political intrigue revolving around ICE’s involvement in cocaine drug trafficking that reporter Penn Bullock—who happened to be my gay husband in high school—has been excavating for almost a decade (and it shows).

They discuss the current state of the LA party scene, as well as its nitrous-fueled punk and rave history, San Francisco’s 90s free parties, and Vivian’s take on how raving has evolved over the last two decades.

As a bonus, the party is taking place at my favorite new ultra-cozy underground loft in LA, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/psstudio_dtla/">Porter Street Studio</a>.

Apple was barely out of the garage, the first web browser was more than a decade away, and the mobile internet remained a fancy of science fiction.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past 50 years, Vinod has witnessed and participated in multiple tectonic technological shifts, from the protean proliferation of the internet to the advancement of computation biology to the imminence of superior artificial intelligence. In that time, he has been the contemporary, employer, or backer of the industry’s most consequential entrepreneurs and executives: Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Eric Schmidt, Jack Dorsey, Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and many, many more. He has, in short, one of the greatest longitudinal views of high-performance innovation of anyone on earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that, I was particularly keen to hear what patterns or shared traits Vinod has observed over the years from partnering with some of the world’s most inventive, disruptive people.&nbsp;</p><p>To hear the characteristics Vinod finds predictive and learn which up-and-coming founders he considers especially exciting, read on.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lessons from Vinod</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Flexibility and stubbornness. </strong>The best entrepreneurs are “flexible in their tactics but obstinate in their vision,” according to Vinod. They must be willing to adapt to the game on the field but constantly keep their end goal in mind. Sam Altman and Patrick Collison are founders Vinod believes exemplify these traits.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Discerning learners</strong>. To survive as a startup CEO, you must be or become a learning machine. The job is so varied that it requires you to level up, day after day, week after week. Exceptional founders are not only fast learners; they are discerning ones. They have no problem throwing out bad ideas, even if presented by a perceived authority figure. They’re equally happy to accept good ones, no matter their provenance.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Some problems are too important</strong>. There are dozens of frameworks and heuristics venture capitalists use to analyze potential investments. For some opportunities, Vinod asks himself a simple, but powerful question: how crucial a problem is this startup solving? Over the years, the Khosla Ventures boss has backed companies principally because they were “too important <em>not</em> to do.” Think nuclear fission, AGI, or plant-based meat.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Keep reading for several more insights from Vinod.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>The Vinod Khosla Collection</h2><p>Today’s letter marks the end of my correspondence with Silicon Valley legend Vinod Khosla.

To build a great and durable company, he argues, founders must ignore traditional wisdom and learn how kindred spirits like Steve Jobs ran their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul refers to this as “founder mode,” a style of building that sits in opposition to the “manager mode” espoused in most business books.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a topic I’ve been thinking about for some time now, greatly aided by the clarity and language of Paul’s piece. Last month, for example, we published <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/the-elon-musk-playbook">The Elon Musk Playbook</a>, highlighting how the SpaceX and Tesla founder’s management runs counter to the orthodoxy.&nbsp;</p><p>I have also thought about Founder Mode a great deal in the context of our correspondence. Over these past few months, we’ve explored your early entrepreneurial origins, the differentiated ways you built management teams and instilled high-leverage cultures, and the extraordinary builders you’ve partnered with. You have lived in Founder Mode and known many of the best to architect their companies in this style, from Jeff Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin to Elon Musk to Patrick Collison to Max Levchin to Brian Chesky, the man that spawned the post. You have known many of the great managers, too, such as your initial inspiration Andy Grove, and old employee, Eric Schmidt.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout our correspondence, there have been anecdotes that seem to capture some of the Founder Mode ethos. For example, in one of our previous exchanges, you noted there had been a debate at Square about whether to launch Cash App. Had Jack Dorsey listened to the conventional wisdom of maintaining singular focus, he would have lost out on much of Square’s market cap.</p><p>It’s a neat example of the kind of contrarian decisions founders have to make and hints at the people behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In our final letter, I would love to focus on this fertile ground. Of the great founders you’ve worked with, what unites them? When you meet an entrepreneur, what signals portend real promise? As they develop, what decisions do they make that less gifted founders might not? As much as you’re able to articulate, I’m keen to understand how you filter for exceptional entrepreneurial talent as an investor and what collaborating with these people has taught you about innovation and constructing large, durable businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>The names we’ve mentioned so far are all well-known and lauded as luminaries in our industry. As you look toward the next decade, which founders do you think have the opportunity to join their ranks? Do you find that the way you work with contemporary founders – the advice you offer, for instance – has changed over the years? What advice would you give to other founders just beginning their journeys? Your career has allowed you to build one of the best personal, longitudinal samples of great entrepreneurs in history. I would love to hear the observations it has sparked.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I just want to end with gratitude. When embarking on this correspondence, I knew I would find it fascinating and fulfilling. However, I didn’t fully appreciate just <em>how </em>fascinating and fulfilling it would be. I’ve learned the power of ignoring your failures, the unreasonable tenacity that can turn even the firmest “no” into a “yes,” the simple but effective way to identify and recruit talented employees, the shape of supertrends (and the rewards they can yield), and much more. It is not an exaggeration to say that your stories have helped me dream a little bigger, be willing to risk a little more, and persevere with added ferocity. I am sure the same is true for many of our readers as they build and back the companies of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>With my sincere thanks,</p><p>Mario</p><div><hr></div><h2>Vinod’s response</h2><p><strong>Subject</strong>: Founder Mode<br><strong>From</strong>: Vinod Khosla<br><strong>To</strong>: Mario Gabriele<br><strong>Date</strong>: Wednesday, September 25 2024 at 10:59 AM PST</p><p>Mario,&nbsp;</p><p>It has been fun to have this conversation with you over the last many months. I am glad it has been helpful to you, and hopefully to many other founders as well.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re right that I’ve gotten to work with many great entrepreneurs who have built incredible companies. Every founder is different, of course, but they do have shared traits.&nbsp;</p><p>What I’m looking for in a founder, above all, is someone<strong> flexible in their tactics but obstinate in their vision.</strong> Patrick Collison is a great example of a founder who is flexible in his tactics. He learns extremely quickly and is able to adapt and iterate. Sam Altman from OpenAI, Max Rhodes from Faire, and Max Levchin from Affirm are other good examples.&nbsp;</p><p>If you sit down with Patrick, for example, you can see how fast he processes. He asks a ton of questions. He wants all the input from you. And based on the feedback he gets from his questions, he’s happy to change his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>People like Patrick or Sam <strong>quickly accept good ideas and reject bad ones</strong>. If they receive new information that invalidates their opinions, they change their minds. If they receive unconvincing information, even if it comes from an authority figure, they reject it easily. They’re not arrogant about their thinking. They just want to find the best answer.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/vinod-khoslas-founder-mode">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   </body></html>	Key insights from tech titans on leadership, innovation, and building successful companies in the digital age.	2024-10-01 11:55:12	2024-10-07 08:07:10.383	2024-10-10 14:04:46.153	{english}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57ebdf19-e3c0-4bd2-b18b-e3e10cb0616a_3742x2839.jpeg	Mario Gabriele	vinod-khoslas-founder-mode

We know this is happening in the EU, <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insights/the-adoption-of-chatgpt/">where a representative study of knowledge workers in Denmark</a> from January found that 65% of marketers, 64% of journalists, 30% of lawyers, among others, had used AI at work. We also know it from a<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60832ecef615231cedd30911/t/66f0c3fbabdc0a173e1e697e/1727054844024/BBD_GenAI_NBER_Sept2024.pdf"> new study of American workers</a> in August, where a third of workers had used Generative AI at work in the last week. (ChatGPT is by far the most used tool in that study, followed by Google’s Gemini)</p></li><li><p>We know that individuals are seeing productivity gains at work for some important tasks. You have almost certainly seen me reference <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged">our work showing consultants completed 18 different tasks 25% more quickly</a> using GPT-4. But another <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566">new study of actual deployments of the original GitHub Copilot for coding</a> found a 26% improvement in productivity (and this used the now-obsolete GPT-3.5 and is far less advanced than current coding tools). This aligns with self-reported data. For example, the Denmark study found that users thought that AI halved their working time for 41% of the tasks they do at work.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png" width="1456" height="592" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:233186,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f82e2e5-bd1b-4b74-9a21-37d291a77c27_1510x614.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Yet, when I talk to leaders and managers about AI use in their company, they often say they see little AI use and few productivity gains outside of narrow permitted use cases. So how do we reconcile these two experiences with the points above?</p><p>The answer is that AI use that boosts individual performance does not always translate to boosting organizational performance for a variety of reasons. To get organizational gains requires R&amp;D into AI use and you are largely going to have to do the R&amp;D yourself. I want to repeat that: <em>you are largely going to have to do the R&amp;D yourself</em>. For decades, companies have outsourced their organizational innovation to consultants or enterprise software vendors who develop generalized approaches based on what they see across many organizations. That won’t work here, at least for a while. Nobody has special information about how to best use AI at your company, or a playbook for how to integrate it into your organization. Even the major AI companies <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1819832350345396469">release models without knowing how they can be best used</a>, discovering use cases as they are shared on Twitter (fine, X). They especially don’t know your industry, organization, or context. We are all figuring this out together. If you want to gain an advantage, you are going to have to figure it out faster.</p><p>So how do you do R&amp;D on ways of using AI? You turn to the Crowd or the Lab. Probably both.</p><h1>Tactics for the Crowd</h1><p>One of my advisors during my PhD at MIT was Prof. Eric von Hippel, who famously developed the concept of user innovation - that many key breakthrough innovations come not from central R&amp;D labs, but from people actually using products and tinkering with them to solve their own problems (<a href="https://evhippel.mit.edu/">you can read a lot about this research on his website</a>). A key reason for this is that experimentation is hard and expensive for outsiders trying to develop new products, but very cheap for workers doing their own tasks. As users are very motivated to make their own jobs easier with technology, they find ways to do so. The user advantage is especially big in experimenting with Generative AI because the systems are unreliable and have a jagged frontier of capability. Experts can easily assess when an AI is useful for their work through trial and error, but an outsider often cannot.</p><p>From the surveys, and many conversations, I know that people are experimenting with AI and finding it very useful. But they aren’t sharing their results with their employers. Instead, almost every organization is completely infiltrated with Secret Cyborgs, people using AI work but not telling you about it.</p><h3>You want Secret Cyborgs? This is how you get Secret Cyborgs</h3><p> Here are a bunch of common reasons people don’t share their AI experiments inside organizations:</p><ul><li><p>They received a scary talk about how improper AI use might be punished. Maybe the talk was vague on what improper use was. Maybe they don’t even want to ask. They don’t want to be punished, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They are being treated as heroes at work for their sensitive emails and rapid coding ability. They suspect if they tell anyone it is AI, people will respect them less, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They know that companies see productivity gains as an opportunity for cost cutting. They suspect that they or their colleagues will be fired if the company realizes that AI does some of their job, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They suspect that if they reveal their AI use, even if they aren’t punished, they won’t be rewarded. They aren’t going to give away what they know for free, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They know that even if companies don’t cut costs and reward their use, any productivity gains will just become an expectation that more work will get done, so they hide their use.</p></li><li><p>They are incentivized to show people their approaches, but they have no way of sharing how they use AI, so they hide their use.</p></li></ul><h3>Getting help from your Cyborgs</h3><p>So how can companies solve this problem? By taking these things seriously.</p><p>First, you need to reduce the fear. Instead of vague talks on AI ethics or terrifying blanket policies, provide clear areas where experimentation of any kind is permitted and be biased towards allowing people to use AI where it is ethically and legally possible (as a side note, many internal legal departments have an outdated view of the risks of AI). Rules and ethical standards are obviously important, but need to be clear and well-understood, not draconian. And fixing policies isn’t enough. Figure out how you will guarantee to your workers that revealing their productivity gains will not lead to layoffs, because it is <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/latent-expertise-everyone-is-in-r">often a bad idea to use technological gains to fire workers at a moment of massive change</a>. For companies with good cultures, this will be easier, but for those where employees have little faith in management, you may need to resort to extreme measures to show that <em>this time</em> you aren’t going to use new technology as an excuse to lay off workers. <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety">Psychological safety</a> is often the key to a willingness to share innovation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png" width="446" height="363.8285052143685" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:863,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:446,&quot;bytes&quot;:183108,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbdc0952-9c8a-4e70-a17c-db009d4cce94_863x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Take a look at just a part of this suggested model AI policy from <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/pdf/practical-guidance/ai/pgexpert-annotated-form-ai-driven-tools-in-the-workplace.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOorwwZdIq8y9fb8u5qY2MveyTtj0fqDq6_epIjpDU3MH-pZQCMbb">LexisNexis</a> and you will quickly see why many employees might not want to “officially” use AI at work</figcaption></figure></div><p>Second, you need to align your award systems. Figure out how to reward people for revealing AI use. If productivity gains happen, workers need to benefit as well. That might mean giving really big awards for really big gains. Think cash prizes that cover months of salary. Promotions. Corner offices. The ability to work from home forever. With the potential productivity gains possible due to LLMs, these are small prices to pay for truly breakthrough innovation. And large incentives also show that the organization is serious.</p><p>Third, model positive use. Executives should be obviously using AI and sharing their use cases with the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/t6xc-_m47_0?si=pZuGzM6XoON0QOJB&amp;t=393">Watch Mary Erdoes, CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset and Wealth Management Group, talk about how the firm is prioritizing AI use at the leadership level, and incorporating their AI experiences into their strategic thinking</a>. And once they become users, managers can encourage their employees to turn to AI first to try to solve their problems. For example, Cynthia Gumbert, CMO of SmartBear, told me that when teams come to her for resources for a new project, if she thinks AI could help, she tells them “Prove to me you can’t do it in AI first, then maybe I will fund the work.”</p><p>Give others the opportunity to show their uses as well. Public-facing events like hackathons (especially including non-technical experts, <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/strategies-for-an-accelerating-future?utm_source=publication-search">I found my MBAs were able to develop useful GPTs for their various jobs, regardless of technical status</a>) and prompt sharing sessions often work well. You also need to think about how to build a community. AI talent can be anywhere in your organization. How are you finding the people who are enthusiastic and talented, and helping them share what they have learned?</p><p>Of course, you also need to give your employees access to tools and training. For tools, that usually means giving them the ability to play directly with a frontier model (probably Claude 3.5, GPT-4o, or Gemini 1.5, through one of many providers) and systems like OpenAI’s GPTs, Claude’s Projects or Google’s Gems that allow them to develop and share more complete solutions. Training is a bit more of a challenge because there is still a lot of discussion over ways to use AI (<a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/captains-log-the-irreducible-weirdness">I gave some advice based on the prompting research  here)</a>, but even just an introductory session can give people permission to innovate.  </p><p>The innovation talent for AI is inside your organization. You need to create the opportunity for it to flourish. The Crowd can help. But there is also a role for a more focused innovation effort: the Lab.</p><h1>Tactics for the Lab</h1><p>As important as decentralized innovation is, there is also a role for a more centralized effort to figure out how to use R&amp;D in your organization. The Lab needs to consist of subject matter experts and a mix of technologists and non-technologists. Fortunately, the Crowd provides your researchers. Those enthusiasts who figure out how to use AI and proudly share it with the company are some of the talents you will use to staff the Lab. Their job will be completely, or mostly, about AI. You need them to focus on building, not analysis or abstract strategy. Here is what they will build:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Build AI benchmarks for your organization. </strong>I<a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/superhuman"> have ranted about the state of benchmarks in AI before</a>, but almost all the AI Labs test on coding and multiple-choice tests of knowledge. These don’t tell you which AI is the most stylish writer or can handle financial data or can best read through a legal document. You need to develop your own benchmarks: how good are each of the models at the tasks you actually do inside of your company? A set of clear business-critical tasks and criteria for evaluating them is key (<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/develop-tests">Anthropic has a guide to benchmarking that can help as a starting place</a>). Without these benchmarks, you are flying blind. You have no idea how good AI systems are, and, even more importantly, you do not know how good they are getting. If you had benchmarks, you would know whether the new o-1 models represent an opportunity or threat, or if they are closing the gap with human performance. Most organizations have no idea.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build prompts and tools that work. </strong>Take the ideas from the Crowd and turn them into fast and dirty products. Iterate and test them. Then release them into your organization and measure what happens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build stuff that doesn’t work… yet. </strong>What would it look like if you used AI agents to do all the work for key business processes? Build it and see where it fails. Then, when a new model comes out, plug it into what you built and see if it is any better. If the rate of advancement continues, this gives you the opportunity to get a first glance at where things are heading, and to actually have a deployable prototype at the first moment AI models improve past critical thresholds.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png" width="2868" height="1034" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1034,&quot;width&quot;:2868,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:563671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12ae6d56-a4da-436d-b216-d6a125e7725d_2868x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">An example of magic and a provocation for academics - I gave the new Gemini model 18 of my academic papers and asked it to write a tenure statement, a process which takes months for humans and is one of the more challenging tasks for academics.

Show how far you can get with an impossible task with AI, or what the latest tools can accomplish. Get the people going.</p></li></ul><p>The Crowd innovates and the Lab builds and tests. A successful internal R&amp;D effort likely involves both.</p><h1>This is just a start</h1><p>In the longer term, innovation is not enough to thrive if AI abilities continue to advance, instead companies will need AI-aware leadership. Our organizations are built around the limitations and benefits of human intelligence, the only form we have had available to us. <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/reshaping-the-tree-rebuilding-organizations">Now, we must figure out how to reconfigure processes and organizational structures that have been developed over decades to take into account the weird “intelligence” of AIs</a>. That requires going beyond R&amp;D to consider organizational structures and goals, and what the role of people and machines are in the organization of the future. The right way to do this is not yet clear, but should be something companies, and the consultants and academics who advise them, need to start working on now.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png" width="471" height="219.9766881028939" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:581,&quot;width&quot;:1244,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:471,&quot;bytes&quot;:38199,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff98a489f-685a-45cf-8068-dee5397ad02a_1244x581.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And yet this may not be radical enough. The explicit goal of the AI labs is to build AIs that are better than humans at every intellectual tasks. They have promised that soon we will have agents - autonomous AIs with goals that can plan and act on their own. Ultimately, as OpenAI’s roadmap shows, they believe they can create AIs that do the work of organizations. None of this may happen, but even if just some it does, the changes to organizations become far more profound, in ways that are difficult to imagine today. For companies, the best way to navigate this uncertainty is to take back some agency and begin to explore this new world for themselves.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png" width="497" height="312.06976744186045" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1376,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:497,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b034381-dffb-443f-b5c9-522b19e414ad_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>And, for fun, I asked Claude to turn this post into a fantasy novel and created a second podcast.

Extreme weather event attribution has long been among the topics most requested by THB readers. In this first post in the series, I introduce some key concepts that will be important as the series evolves over the coming weeks and months. I’m counting on your engagement throughout the series.</p><p><em>Weather event attribution</em> does not appear in the <a href="https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/">IPCC Glossary</a>, however it does appear in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/">the body of the AR6 report</a>, where the IPCC explains that event attribution research seeks to “to attribute aspects of specific extreme weather and climate events to certain causes.” </p><p>The IPCC <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/">continues</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Scientists cannot answer directly whether a particular event was caused by climate change,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> as extremes do occur naturally, and any specific weather and climate event is the result of a complex mix of human and natural factors. Instead, scientists quantify the relative importance of human and natural influences on the magnitude and/or probability of specific extreme weather events.” </p></blockquote><p>In future installments we will get into the gory details — the strengths and weaknesses — of the various approaches to event attribution studies. With this post I want to introduce three starting points for our discussions which will unfold over a series of posts in coming weeks and months.</p><p>First, event attribution research is a form of <em><a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review">tactical science</a> </em>— research performed explicitly to serve legal and political ends. This is not my opinion, but has been openly stated on many occasions by the researchers who developed and perform event attribution research.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Such research is not always subjected to peer review, and this is <a href="https://ascmo.copernicus.org/articles/6/177/2020/ascmo-6-177-2020.pdf">often by design</a> as peer-review takes much longer than the news cycle. Instead, event attribution studies are generally promoted via press release.</p><p>For instance, researchers behind the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03071-7">explain </a>that one of their key motives in conducting such studies is, “increasing the ‘immediacy’ of climate change, thereby increasing support for mitigation.” WWA’s chief scientist, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060775163">Friederike Otto, explains</a>, “Unlike every other branch of climate science or science in general, event attribution was actually originally suggested with the courts in mind.” Another oft-quoted scientist who performs rapid attribution analyses, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/trump-says-florence-is-just-mother-nature-a-stunning-new-climate-study-says-hes-wrong-7bf6311110be/">Michael Wehner</a>, summarized their importance (emphasis in original) — “The most important message from this (and previous) analyses is that “<strong>Dangerous climate change is here now!</strong>” </p><p>Weather event attribution methodologies have been developed not just to feed media narratives or support general climate advocacy. Otto and others have been very forthright that the main function of such studies is to create a defensible scientific basis in support of lawsuits against fossil fuel companies — She explains the strategy in detail in this interview, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV47jTQ9Om4">From Extreme Event Attribution to Climate Litigation</a>.</p><p>As I recently argued, tactical science is not necessarily bad science, but it should elevate the degree of scrutiny that such analyses face, especially when they generally are not subjected to independent peer review. In this series I’ll apply some scrutiny and invite you to participate as we go along.</p><p>Second, extreme event attribution was developed as a response to <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-no-stinking-science">the failure of the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution (D&amp;A) to reach high confidence</a> in the detection of increasing trends in the frequency or intensity of most types of impactful extreme events — notably hurricanes, floods, drought, and tornadoes. </p><p>Here is how I <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-be-a-smart-consumer-of-climate">recently explained</a> the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution:</p><blockquote><p>To ensure rigor in its work, the IPCC has employed a statistical framework for concluding that extreme weather phenomena has actually increased (or decreased) and the factors responsible for such changes. The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/glossary/">detection of changes</a></em>&nbsp;required quantifying a change in the statistics of weather extremes over climate time scales of 30 years or even longer. Once detection was achieved, then scientists seek to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/glossary/">attribute those changes</a></em>&nbsp;to particular causes, including the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p><p>When it comes to many types of extreme events&nbsp;<a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-understand-the-new-ipcc-report-1e3">the IPCC has for decades</a>&nbsp;been unable to conclusively detect changes in their frequency or intensity. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">the IPCC has reported</a>&nbsp;increases in heat waves and in heavy precipitation, but not tropical cyclones (including hurricanes), floods, tornadoes or drought.</p></blockquote><p>The IPCC’s inability to reach high confidence in detection and attribution of most types of extreme events has been viewed by climate advocates as politically problematic. For instance, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017EF000665">Elizabeth Lloyd and Naomi Oreskes argue</a> that the IPCC’s lack of strong claims on extreme event detection and attribution,</p><blockquote><p>“. . . conveys the impression that we just do not know, which feeds into both contrarian claims that climate science is in a state of high uncertainty, doubt, or incompleteness, and the general tendency of humans to discount threats that are not imminent.”</p></blockquote><p>The underlying theory of change here appears to be that people must be fearful of climate change and thus need come to understand that it threatens their lives, not in the future, but today and tomorrow. If they don’t have that fear, the argument goes, then they will discount the threat and fail to support the <em>right </em>climate policies. Hence, from this perspective, the IPCC”s failure to reach strong claims of detection and attribution represents a political problem — a problem that can be rectified via the invention of extreme event attribution.</p><p>The IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 acknowledges extreme event attribution research in its <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/">Chapter 11</a> but does not privilege it over the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution. The IPCC AR6 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12/">Chapter 12</a> relies on the IPCC’s conventional approach to detection and attribution, and appears to dismiss event attribution studies with a single sentence, </p><blockquote><p>“The usefulness or applicability of available extreme event attribution methods for assessing climate-related risks remains subject to debate.”</p></blockquote><p>I expect that there is to come a significant collision between those researchers who support the conventional IPCC approach to detection and attribution and those of a more activist inclination who favor single event attribution. This expected conflict will be the subject of a future post in this series.</p><p>Third, and finally for today, I want to once again <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-climate-fix-book-club-chapter-53c">emphasize the reality and risks of changes in climate due to human activities</a> — notably the burning of fossil fuels, but also land use change, particulate pollution, and other forcings. The importance of climate change as an issue does not mean that we can or should ignore scientific integrity. We live in a time when far too often calls for scientific integrity are criticized by political campaigners (including scientists) when certain scientific understandings do not align perfectly with this or that political agenda.</p><p>For example, some dismiss entirely the possibility of human-caused changes in climate while others quickly claim that every weather event is more extreme or more common due to climate change. These extreme positions are roughly aligned with the far right and far left respectively — and discussion of climate science and policy has long been dominated by these extremes. </p><p>Climate science is not, or at least should not serve as, a proxy for political tribes. As this series evolves I’ll make arguments backed up by logic and evidence.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> You might or might not find these arguments convincing! Regardless, tell me about it — I invite your challenges, critique, and especially your interpretations of the relevant literature, methods, data, and arguments. Honest brokering is a group effort. </p><p>It would be useful as we proceed, but not necessary, to read up on some background on extreme weather events, climate change, disasters, and event attribution that is available here at THB (and the many links to sources therein) — and as the series goes along I’ll provide many links to a diversity of readings:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-be-a-smart-consumer-of-climate">How to be a Smart Consumer of Climate Attribution Claims</a> (2023)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-politics-of-our-climate-attribution">The Politics of Our Climate Attribution Obsession</a> (2021)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/class-is-in">A 20-part THB Series on Extreme Weather and Climate</a> (2024)</p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weather-attribution-alchemy/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weather-attribution-alchemy/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

Bad science is where data is have been cherry-picked— when some data have been deliberately left out—or it’s impossible for the reader to understand the steps that were taken to produce or analyze the data. It is a set of claims that can’t be tested, claims that are based on samples that are too small, and claims that don’t follow from the evidence provided. And science is bad—or at least weak—when proponents of a position jump to conclusions on insufficient or inconsistent data.”</p></blockquote><p>Few would disagree with the Oreskes and Conway criteria of “bad science,” but how do we use the criteria to distinguish bad science from good science? Oreskes and Conway have an answer (emphasis in original):</p><blockquote><p>“But while these scientific criteria may be clear in principle, knowing when they apply in practice is a judgment call. For this scientists rely on peer review. Peer review is a topic that is impossible to make sexy, but it’s crucial to understand, because it is what makes science science—and not just a form of <em>opinion</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Oreskes and Conway characterize “Potemkin village science” as the efforts of “merchants of doubt” to make their bad-science arguments look science-like using data and graphs — to fool the uninformed and contest the good science in the peer-reviewed literature. The good guys publish in peer reviewed publications, while the bad guys do not.</p><p>The idealization of peer review as the arbiter of good science is problematic for many reasons, but one is that it downplays the possibility that bad science can appear in the peer reviewed literature and good science outside of those outlets. </p><p>Today, I focus on the use and abuse of the peer reviewed literature to produce <em>tactical science</em> which I define as:</p><blockquote><p>Publications — often targeted for the peer reviewed literature — designed and constructed to serve extra-scientific ends, typically efforts to shape public opinion, influence politics, or serve legal action.</p></blockquote><p>I first became aware of tactical science in 2008, when Princeton professor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101116080021/http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/34156">Stephen Pacala explained candidly</a> that his famous 2004 “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1100103">stabilization wedges</a>” paper (with Robert Socolow) was actually written to serve political ends and to marginalize other researchers:</p><blockquote><p>“The purpose of the stabilization wedges paper was narrow and simple – we wanted to stop the Bush administration from what we saw as a strategy to stall action on global warming by claiming that we lacked the technology to tackle it. The Secretary of Energy at the time used to give a speech saying that we needed a discovery as fundamental as the discovery of electricity by Faraday in the 19th century.</p><p>We also wanted to stop the group of scientists that were writing what I thought were grant proposals masquerading as energy assessments. There was <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1072357">one famous paper published in </a><em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1072357">Science</a></em> that went down the list [of available technologies] fighting them one by one but never asked "what if we put them all together?" It was an analysis whose purpose was to show we lacked the technology, with a call at the end for blue sky research.</p><p>I saw it as an unhealthy collusion between the scientific community who believed that there was a serious problem and a political movement that didn’t. I wanted that to stop and the paper for me was surprisingly effective at doing that. I’m really happy with how it came out – I wouldn’t change a thing.”</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png" width="482" height="482" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:482,&quot;bytes&quot;:1491476,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4aa969c-598d-4035-b434-e409b5068641_720x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Scientists say . . .</figcaption></figure></div><p>Since then, I’ve seen tactical science become increasingly prevalent in the climate science literature. Here are just a few examples of tactical science that is also bad science:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.1934">Howarth (2024, published just today)</a>. Funded by the <a href="https://www.parkfoundation.org/funding-priorities/environment/">Park Foundation — opponents of natural gas</a> — and released as a pre-print apparently to support the Biden Administration’s LNG pause. <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/a-major-paper-on-liquified-natural-gas-emissions-is-riddled-with-errors">Jonah Messinger explains</a> why this paper is riddled with errors.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52437-9">Serofim et al (2024)</a>. Funded by EPA — and written by EPA, one of its government contractors, and others — the paper defends EPA’s continued use of RCP8.5, which is <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/secret-sauce">fundamental to the Biden Administration’s “social cost of carbon.”</a> Jessica Weinkle has <a href="https://jessicaweinkle.substack.com/p/information-literacy-in-our-technocratic">a must-read eye-opening post on this paper</a>. RCP8.5 is <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-unstoppable-momentum-of-outdated-c2f">indefensible</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2007117117">Schwalm et al. 2020</a>. From the Woodwell Climate Research Center, which is funded by McKinsey — a heavy user of RCP8.5, the paper also justifies the continued prioritization of RCP8.5. The <a href="https://x.com/RogerPielkeJr/status/1290638311732600832">paper relies on fanciful assumptions</a> of massive increases in land use carbon dioxide emissions completely at odds with observations and the IPCC.</p></li></ul><p>None of the three papers above disclosed the interests of funders in the published results of the analyses. If you click through the links above you will find detailed critiques of each paper.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> At the same time, each paper is heavily cited in other research and in political settings because each is tactically useful. </p><p>Each paper is an outlier in the context of relevant research — and will be unlikely to change how scientific assessments review the overall literature. They offer a seemingly plausible counter to the broader literature, allowing politically expedient claims to be justified in terms of “science.”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>The three climate papers above are bad science not simply because they are tactical science, but because they are bad science — the demonstration of which requires employing good science.</p><p>Tactical science occurs in many contexts beyond climate change. For instance, a <a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/crits-christoph-et-al-2024-retraction">group of scientists</a> focused on opening up debate on COVID-19 origins have systematically alleged that a suite of papers arguing for a market-based origin are, “<a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/crits-christoph-et-al-2024-retraction">based on invalid premises and conclusions, or are potentially products of scientific misconduct — including fraud</a>.” Of course, <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/why-proximal-origins-must-be-retracted">here at THB</a> and <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/proximal-origins-scientific-integrity">for the U.S. Congress</a> I have extensively documented how the so-called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9">Proximal Origins</a> paper provides perhaps the most well-known example of tactical science.</p><p>What are we to do about tactical science? I have a few suggestions:</p><ul><li><p>First, we should all recognize that peer-review provides a minimal standard of review. It certainly does not provide a demarcation between good and bad science. There is plenty of very good science not in peer reviewed journals and plenty of dreck in peer reviewed journals — and this has always been the case, well beyond issues of tactical science.</p></li><li><p>We experts should pay close attention to peer-reviewed papers after they are published — the claims they make, the evidence they employ, the methods they use, and the potentially overlapping interests of funders and authors. In short, a peer reviewed publication represents just one, arguably early, step in evaluating scientific claims. This lesson is one that has motivated interest in recent years in replication and reproduction of scientific analyses.</p></li><li><p>The scientific community needs to do a much better job ensuring that the institutions of science — including but not limited to journals — are simply doing their jobs. For instance, I recently documented how <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/a-thb-follow-up-climate-research">PNAS refused to retract a paper</a> that used a “dataset” that does not exist. I also recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44304-024-00011-0">published a paper</a> on the many problems with the politically-opportune “billion dollar disaster” tabulation.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> Journal editors are also people with interests in tactics. An entire Substack could be devoted to tactical science.</p></li><li><p>For journalists and the broader public it is important to understand that peer review does not organically produce truth and that the same forces that shape public debates over scientific claims also show up in research and publishing. It’s complicated, that is just a fact. </p></li></ul><p>Knowing what is good science and what is bad science is more difficult than ever in 2024. Some offer simple shortcuts to the truth — Look at the author’s funding, perhaps their politics, the virtuousness of the causes they support, or perhaps appeal to authority, consensus, or ask a fact checker in the media. The broader context within which research takes place is useful to know but does not offer us a shortcut to the truth.</p><p>As I often say, there is no shortcut — science <em>is</em> the shortcut.</p><p>Peer reviewed journals have increasingly become another arena of political conflict on issues that are politically contentious. Science and politics are of course impossible to keep totally separate. However, the good news is that we are well prepared to make judgments between good and bad science, should we wish to. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/weaponizing-peer-review/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

population:</p><blockquote><p>“In the end, aging plays the starring role”</p></blockquote><p>The trend is <em>not</em> primarily due to the expansion of social programs: </p><blockquote><p>“The expansion of the social safety net—new programs, increased generosity, and increased coverage—explains only a small portion of the overall rise in the transfer share.”</p></blockquote><p>There is considerable variation across communities, but aging represents a national-level dynamic:</p><blockquote><p>“[T]he 65 and over share of the population and the poverty rate are not strongly correlated with each other, with a correlation coefficient of -0.014.</p><p>This suggests that each is useful for explaining transfer levels across the map, but that they apply in different places, and only one—aging—is good at explaining nationwide changes in transfers over time.</p><p>In part, this is because many deeply economically distressed and high-transfer areas—the heart of Appalachia, for example—have been distressed and transfer-dependent for a long time, while aging has been a much more dynamic phenomenon that has also affected more places.”</p></blockquote><p>Let’s reemphasize this point:</p><blockquote><p>“[T]he nation’s poor population is growing nowhere near as quickly as its elderly population.

It is bad for what it signals about the economic health of American communities, and it is bad for the fiscal health of the country.</p><p>Across huge swathes of the American map, aging has pushed transfers higher while local economic struggles have suppressed growth in other earnings. The result is a reshaping of how communities derive their livelihood—and a fading importance of work and productive activity in generating local incomes.”</p></blockquote><p>Our traditional politics would suggest that to try to boost GDP growth and reduce reliance on government transfers, those on the political right will emphasize cutting government spending on transfers and those on the political left will emphasize raising taxes. EIG cautions that neither approach alone can work — and even with both, more needs to be done:</p><blockquote><p>The country is on a collision course with politically fraught trade-offs. Raising revenues through significantly increased taxes could choke off the very economic activity that finances transfers. Dramatically cutting spending on programs and benefits would unravel parts of the safety net that dignify life in the United States. Tax hikes and entitlement reform are also not enough to solve the problem, either alone or together. Both options must be part of the solution—but not the only part.</p></blockquote><p>What else needs to occur? Greater economic growth:</p><blockquote><p>Faster economic growth is essential to regaining the path back to fiscal health. Investments in research and innovation, an expansive and better designed immigration policy, tax and regulatory policies that foster economic dynamism and participation in the workforce—these and other parts of a growth agenda represent the ideal way to reduce dependence on transfers, by boosting incomes earned from work and investing.</p></blockquote><p>I would hypothesize that there is some degree of correlation between those places that have seen “significant” government transfers and higher Trump shares of the 2020 vote (you can eyeball the figure below). The reason for that hypothesis is that many communities with “significant” government transfers are — as explained above — “subsisting” but not “thriving.”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> In contrast, many communities that are “thriving” have “moderate” or “minimal” government transfers. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png" width="452" height="615" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:615,&quot;width&quot;:452,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:346867,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5834118b-8e82-47ec-984f-7fc64d4b1a18_452x615.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sources: Top, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election">Wikipedia</a>; Bottom, <a href="https://eig.org/great-transfermation/">EIG 2024</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Democrats have <a href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/how-trump-wins">increasingly become the party of the educated, wealthy elite</a>, they become identified — rightly or wrongly — as those who bear responsibility for the underlying reasons for those left behind, as the make-up of the U.S. and global economies have shifted. Trump’s populist MAGA appeal taps into this vein, but ironically, offers nothing in the way of sensible policy to “foster economic dynamism.” Kamala Harris apparently understands this, making an “<a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf">opportunity economy</a>” central to her rhetoric. But the Harris campaign as well suffers from a lack of sensible policy to “foster economic dynamism.”</p><p>That leaves us with vibes and partisan politics.

In fact, give demographic projections they will likely get worse in the absence of effective action.</p><p>The United States is going to have to again take seriously the importance of policies underlying improved economic growth. These policies are not going to be simple slogans and necessarily will draw from thinking on the right and on the left. To be effective they will necessitate compromise and pragmatism. That is a big ask for 2025, but the alternatives are much worse.</p><p>The EIG reports concludes:</p><blockquote><p>Not since the aftermath of World War II has the country been forced to confront such a troubling fiscal situation. In recent years the federal debt has returned to those all-time highs as a share of GDP—only it has happened through the normal course of business rather than the exigencies of war. The country now runs historically large deficits at every point in the business cycle.</p><p>In the immediate post-war period, favorable demographics could be counted on to grow the economy back to fiscal sustainability. No such tailwind exists today. That is why, to truly address the underlying challenge, a growth agenda must include a heavy focus on making it easier to start and sustain families. Demographic vitality and economic vitality go hand in hand.</p><p>If there is a silver lining, it is that the rapid aging of the U.S. population is, at least relative to the same trend in other advanced economies, a new phenomenon. By reinvigorating the productive capacity and demographic health of the United States, it is still possible to prevent the country from becoming an ever more dependent one—but only if we get started now.</p></blockquote><p>For further reading:</p><p>Burgess, M.

Užėjęs į vieną barą bandžiau seną triuką, padedantį išvengti arbatpinigių. Po maisto pasakiau padavėjui:<br>– Labai geras aptarnavimas, bet neturiu grynų. Negaliu palikti arbatos.<br>– Tai pas mus jau galima kortele. Va, čia nuskanuokite šį barkodą ir palikite kiek norite.<br>Arbatpinigių pavyko išvengti pasakius, kad palikau mobilų telefoną namie. <br>– Bet jūs ką tik atsiskaitėte telefonu., – bandė kaulyti padavėjas.<br>– Čia mano darbinis. Su juo galiu tik už maistą mokėti, – nemirktelėjęs atsikirtau.</p><p>Situacija nebuvo labai maloni, tačiau nėra to blogo, kas neišeitų į gerą. Lengvas šokas pagimdė idėją – baruose slapta prikaišioti savo arbatpinigių kortelių, tačiau jos būtų su barkodais į mūsų banko sąskaitą. Sakau į mūsų, nes jau vertinu TAVE kaip savo verslo partnerį. Taigi ką aš siūlau:</p><p><strong>Programuotojai</strong><br>Jūs suprogramuojate mums tinkantį barkodą. Darbas neapmokamas, todėl kreipiuosi tik į profesionalus. Tikrai nenorėčiau, kad nemokamai nepatyręs programuotojas prie šio projekto gaištų savaitę nevalgęs. Kai tuo tarpu patyręs programuotojas viską lengvai padarytų tiesiog sėdėdamas ant tualeto. Patyręs programuotojau, vietoj skrolinimo ant tūliko, gali mums padėti.</p><p><strong>Grafikos dizaineriai</strong><br>Jums bus atsiųstos nuotraukos su barų arbatpinigių kortelių dizainu. Jums reikės atkartoti baro dizaino logotipą ir uždėti mūsų barkodą. Darbas nepamokamas, tačiau jeigu jums pavyks tiksliai atkartoti dizainą, tokiais darbais galėsite dalintis su klientais ir jie neatsispirs jūsų paslaugoms.</p><p><strong>Fotografijos studentai<br></strong>Šitas darbas neapmokamas, tačiau puiki progra pasipildyti portfolio. Jums reikia nufotografuoti baruose esančių kortelių dizainus. Kuo daugiau skirtingų dizainų nufotografuosite, tuo didesnis jūsų portfolio, tuo geresniais fotografais tapsite!</p><p><strong>Spaustuvės</strong><br>Jums lengviausia užduotis, reikia tiesiog NEMOKAMAI atspausdinti dizainus ant plastikinių kortelių. Tai nėra paprastas nemokamas užsakymas, tai investicija į Lietuvos ateitį. </p><p><strong>Logistikos praktikantai</strong><br>Norite dirbti logistikos įmonėse, tačiau neturite praktikos? Pas mus galite atlikti praktiką tai yra sudaryti kortelių išvežiojimo planus ir pasirūpinti, kad jos būtų pristatomos į atitinkamus barus.</p><p><strong>Logistikos praktikantų giminaičiai<br></strong>Niekas nenori turėti niekam tikusių bedarbių giminaičių. Todėl siūlome padėti, kad logistikoje planuojantys dirbti artimieji, pasiektų savo tikslų. Jie jums pateiktų barus, kuriuose turi būti kortelės. Jūs tas korteles paimtumėte iš spaustuvių. Žinoma, jūsų kvailiukai giminaičiai pridarys klaidų – būkite jiems atlaidūs. Patys atidžiai patikrinkite, ar kortelės logotipas atitinka baro logotipą, ar baro adresas geras ir panašiai. Padėkite giminaičiams! Už draugišką giminystę.</p><p><strong>Influenseriai</strong><br>Norite gauti didesnių užsakymų? Gaunate nusiskundimų, kad jūsų storiai tik reklama? Šis pasiūlymas kaip tik jums. Pasidalinkite įrašu, kuris skatintų žmones būti supratingais ir palikinėti daugiau arbatpinigių.  Kaip tai padarysite visiška jūsų laisvė. Žinoma, dėl bendro sutarimo prieš publikuodami visus storius atsiųskite man, kad galėčiau juos patikrinti. Storiai papostinti be mano sutikimo, bus traktuojami kaip idėjos vogimas.</p><p><strong>Aktyvistai</strong><br>Jums rūpi socialinė gerovė. Viskas ko reikia mieste pripaišyti juodų trafaretų su tekstu: Atriškite rankas padavėjams. Palikite arbatpinigių. Vergovei – NE!</p><p><strong>Programuotojai antra komanda</strong><br>Vėl reikia tik profesionalų. Naivūs vos sesiją baigiantys studentai – nesivarginkite. Darbas neapmokamas, bet kokybiškai neapmokamas. Mieli profesionalai, viskas ko reikėtų iš jūsų, suprogramuoti, kad dešimt procentų nuo gaunamų pajamų sugrįžtų padavėjams. <br>Tai yra aš nenoriu būti žūlikas ir pasiimti visų arbatpinigių. Be to, jei visi arbatpinigiai nusėstų pas mane – policija labai greitai pričiuptų. O jūs kaip ir bendrininkai, tai noriu apsaugoti ir jus.</p><p><strong>Nežinau kaip jūs įvardinti</strong><br>Žodžiu, jeigu jums buvo tokia problema, kad norėjote gauti paskolą, tačiau trūko pajamų. Šis pasiūlymas jums. Į jūsų sąskaitą suplauktų visi pinigai. Tada aš jums išrašau sąskaitą už stendupą ir pervedate visus pinigus man. Metų gale gautas pajamas deklaruojate ir taip keliate savo kreditingumą. Žinoma, mokesčių mokėjimas, pajamų pagrindimas – čia jau jūsų problema. Aš už jus visko negaliu padaryti.</p><p>Taigi toks mano verslo planas. Labai lauksiu norinčių prisidėti. Savaime suprantama, kadangi šis verslo planas laviruoja ant legalumo ribos, iškilus problemoms su teisėsauga, būčiau dėkingas jei mano vardo neminėtumėte.</p><p>Kadangi visi dirbsime nemokamai, tačiau valgyti reikia (nebent esate profesionalūs programuotojai daug pinigų gaunantys už nieką). Turiu jums draugišką patarimą – vokite iš savų. Geriausia iš labai artimų giminaičių ar draugų su kuriais labai gerai sutariate. Kuo geriau ir kuo ilgiau gerai sutariate tuo vėliau jie pastebės, kad vagiate iš jų. Jie paprasčiausiai atmes jūsų kandidatūrą į vagis. O kai pastebės bandys gražiai tartis, o ne iš karto kaip kokie šalti nepažįstami puls į policiją. </p><p>Kai draugai ar giminaičiai supras, kad tai jūsų darbeliai, nesiginčykite su jais. Linksėkite galvą ir planuokite vagystes iš kitų draugų. </p><p>Iki kito antradienio.</p><p>Gitarinių sentimentų ir skirtingų kartų bandymų susigaudyti pasaulyje, kai atrodo, kad nėra už ko nusitverti:</p><p>Laura Jane Grace - Walking Is Still Honest</p><div id="youtube2-k8_D34RCaQM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;k8_D34RCaQM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k8_D34RCaQM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>TV Smith - Generation Y </p><div id="youtube2-8OpVEBPayUY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;8OpVEBPayUY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8OpVEBPayUY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Dar pradėjau rašyti trumpus dalykėlius. Tokius:</p><p>***</p><p>Atsiprašau, gal galiu jus nufotografuoti? Klausiu taksisto, stovinčio prie Halės turgaus. Kodėl norit? Nu, nėra, kad kiekvieną dieną matyčiau mezgantį taksistą. O kam jums ta nuotrauka? Draugai nepatikės, jei foto nebus. Nenoriu būti jūsų eksponatu. Kodėl mezgate? Terapija po insulto. Atsiprašau. Nieko tokio viskas tik į gerą. O ką mezgate? Jūsų likimą. Kiek man liko? Keturi. Ko keturi? Keturi, trys, du, vienas. Nu, ir? Kas ir? Nesupratau,  ko man liko keturi. Banko sąskaitos likutį pasitikrink.</p><p>Pradedu tikrinti banko likutį. Sakau, tam durniui, kad niekas nepasikeitė. O tas taksioras prašo, kad galėtų mane nufotkinti. Klausiu, kodėl?</p><p>Noriu draugams parodyt. Nekiekvieną dieną sutinku žmonių, kurie tiki, kad taksistas po insulto su virbalais gali išmegzti banko sąskaitą.</p><p>***</p><p>Nešdamas šiukšles prie konteinerio sutikau buvusį grupioką. Apsikeitėm keliais  žodžiais. Kai neišmestas šiukšles bandžiau sukišti į prekybos centro šiukšlinę. Čia savo negalima. Gavau iš apsauginio. Negalima tai negalima. Eidamas toliau ir ieškodamas kito konteinerio galvojau apie kylančią ekonomiką, dirbtinį intelektą ir tai, kad būtent batai išdavė grupioką. Prakeikti batai. Tie nutrinti naikai, aptaškyti mėlynais grindų dažais ir kaimyno išmesti prieš porą dienų. Prakeikti batai. Kai prie picerijos apsauginių priėjo benamis ir pasiteiravo ar ten Daškė. Jam nueinant apsauginiai pastebėjo prabangius batus. Vėliau paaiškėjo, kad tai buvo ne benamis, o snaiperis, nušovęs Daškę. Prakeikti batai. New Yorke vyras, pardavinėjęs gatvėje eglutes pasakojo, kad prieš pasakydamas kainą žiūri į batus. Kartais eglutę dovanoju, kartais nuplešiu tiek kiek dovanų eglutę žmogus per savaitę išleidžia maistui. Prakeikti batai. Senelis vaikystėje pakliuvo į ligoninę, nes į mokyklą gruodžio mėnesį atėjo basas. Geriau basas nei klasiokų patyčios dėl klumpių. Dėl prakeiktų mėlynais dažais aptaškytų naikų, negalėjau išmesti šiukšlių. Nes maiše buvo vištiena, nuo kurios dieną prieš trims iš keturių mano svečių paleido vidurius. Nenorėjau, kad tą vištą valgytų grupiokas.</p><p>Norėjau tą vištą sušerti dėstytojai. Grupioko 4,65 balo suapvalinusiai iki 4. Ketvertą po kurio kitą kartą grupioką pamačiau prie konteinerio su prakeiktais mėlynais dažais aptaškytais naikais.</p><p>***</p><p>Vakar nesuveikė judesio lempa laiptinėje. Kaip greit savo orientacinį budrumą patikim davikliui iš Kinijos. Krisdamas spėjau pagalvoti.  Geriau vėliau negu niekada, suskambėjo kai su galvą trinktelėjus į radiatorių, kiniškas daviklis suveikė ir lempa užsidegė. Galiu pasakyti tik tiek, jei gyvenimas duoda močiutės kiaušinių - imkit juos nesivaržydami. Niekada nežinai, kada jie suveiks kaip oro pagalvė ir gulėdamas močiutės kiaušinių glitime džiaugsiesi, kad dėl jų telefono nesudaužei. Telefonas dar kartą krito ant žemės, kai pasilenkiau su skuduru valyti močiutės kiaušinių glitimo nuo grindų. Nepuoliau jo kelti. Mėgavausi Šriodingerio katės situacija. Kol nepakeltas telefonas, tol jis ir sudužęs, ir nesudužęs vienu metu. Kvantinė fizika buityje. O kažin kiek buities gali būti kvantinėje fizikoje? Atomai traukia ir stumia vieni kitus vienu metu. Neapsisprendę. Tikras buitekas. Telefonas  sudužo. Nu, bet visokių dienų yra. Visokių reikia. Bet negirt dienos be vakaro tas pats, kas negirt gyvenimo kol neišeini į pensiją. Liaudies išmintis pagyrimo raštais nesisklaido. Todėl kartais pasakau “op” ir per griovį nebešoku. Nes mano griovys aukščiau bambos. Aš nežinau, kas čia buvo, bet jei gyvenimas duoda močiutės kiaušinių – imkit, nes gal juos valgydami sukursit išgalvotą postą apie nesuveikusį judesio daviklį.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://domasraibys.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://domasraibys.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p></p></body></html>	Verslo planas siūlo slaptai keisti barų arbatpinigių korteles į savas, nukreipiant pinigus į savo sąskaitą.

Nes negali būti nieko baisiau kai sau ramiai skrolini feisbuke ir kas nors skambina darbo reikalais:</p><p>– Klausau.</p><p>– Čia dėl to stendapo. Turėjote praeitą savaitę pasirodyti, o dar nepasirodote.</p><p>– Žinokit, aš vis dar labai užsiėmęs.</p><p>– Bet mes čia su įmone jau antra savaitė laukiame.</p><p>– Priminkite, kur ir kiek laiko jūs manęs laukiate?</p><p>– Biržų aktų salė. Trečia savaitė. </p><p>– Bet čia juk viena geriausių aktų salių. Laukiamajame net karšto šokolado yra. Dabar negaliu. Gal kitą savaitę.</p><p>– Tai mums dar ir kitą savaitę imti neapmokamų atostogų?</p><p>– Taip, jei nenorite pravaikštų.</p><p>Trumpi skambučiai, bet vis tiek išmuša iš vėžių. Todėl dažnai sėdžiu skrolinu naktį. Taip buvo ir praeitą naktį skrolinu. Ir girdžiu kažkas traška. Atsisuku. Aišku už nugaro nieko nėra. Bet ir garsas nutyla. Toliau skrolinu. Ir vėl girdžiu, toks lyg tarškėjimas. Kurį laiką mintis, kad čia mano biologinis laikrodis taip nuo bėgimo išdžiūvo ir tiksi. Vos nepradėjau gūglinti “how to oil your biological clock”.</p><p>Vėl žiūriu už nugaros. Ten vienintelis galimas garso šaltinis – gėlė. Prieš akis pradeda bėgti tie visi timelepsai, kur pagreitintai auga gėlės. Pradėjau galvoti, kad girdžiu kaip auga gėlė. Kyla unikali mintis – įrašyti gėlės augimo garsą. Bet vos prieinu prie tos gėlės ji lyg ir nutyla. Pradėjau galvoti gal aš gėlei šviesą užstoju ir ji nebegali augti. Bet kokia šviesa naktį? Ir netyčia mano žvilgsnis nukrypsta į malkas šalia židinio. Ir suvokiu, kad tas garsas sklinda, greičiausiai, iš malkuose esančių kirvarpų. </p><p>Tada pradedu galvoti, kad tie vargšai Biržų aktų salėje tarška kaip tos kirvapos. Trina salės kėdes, parketą, dėvi vandentiekio sistemą. Biržų aktų salė yra kaip negalintis apsiginti medžio gabalas, taršomas kirvarpų. Net baisu įsivaizduoti, kokių nuobodybių turi klausytis aktų salės sienos. Nedelsiant skambinu į Biržus:</p><p>– Alio.– apsimiegojęs balsas.</p><p>– Ruoškitės stendapui. Tuoj būsiu.</p><p>Čia naujas klumpių video. Iki bėgimo liko mažiau nei dvi savaitės:</p><div id="youtube2-8O3ozQ0k6TI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;8O3ozQ0k6TI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8O3ozQ0k6TI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>O čia dar keletas trumpų istorijų:</p><p>Nežinau ar teisinga nuteisti žmones, išimant vieną negražų segmentą iš jų gyvenimo. Spręsti jums. Vakar naktį mačiau kaip mano kaimynas, lėkdamas su mašina, aptaškė du praeivius. Labai sunervino. Priėjau prie tų dviejų bičų. Baisūs tokie. Pasakiau, kad žinau, kur jo mašina stovi. Pasiūliau. Visiškai ant bajerio. Palaukti ir su raktu subraižyti. Ant bajerio. O tie rimtai priėmė. Taip entuziastingai, kad aš jau negalėjau gaidintis ir neberodyti mašinos. Nueinam į mano kiemą. Matom mašiną. Tie pradeda mėtytis. Aš vėl ant bajerio jiems pasakau, kad jau tamsu ir kamerų pas mus nėra. Išsitraukiam raktus. Aš tai ant bajerio. Nesitikėjau, kad tie braižys. Jiems braižant, o man tupint iš kitos pusės. Mašina atsirakina ir užsidega šviesos. Kaimynas kažką paliko mašinoje. Tie bėgti prie vartų. Vargšai nerado mygtuko. Mašiną su raktu braižyti nagli, bet kai reikia galvą naudoti, nebeišeina. Kaimynas iškvietė policiją. Aš, prisidengęs tamsa, įsliūkinau į savo laiptinę. Grįžau pasimetęs. Nusliūkindamas girdėjau kaip jie visi trys gražiai kalbėjosi. Tipo visi nekalti. Avinėliai. Nors gal be reikalo aš juos teisiu. Nors manęs tai jau neliečia, dabar greitai temsta, rekomenduoju užsidėti atšvaistą, kad kaimynas laiku pamatytų ir nereikėtų staigiai į balas sukti ir taip aptaškyti kitus žmones.</p><p>***</p><p>Traukiny moteris per telefoną klausosi muzikos. Priešais sėdintis vyras, mandagiai pasiūlo paskolinti ausines. Moteris nesupranta. Atsako, kad ausinių nenaudoja. Mes visi girdime, kad nenaudojate. Bet kodėl nenaudojate? Šypsosi vyras. Nes jeigu šitą šūdiną muziką pasileisčiau per ausines man pradėtų kraujuoti ausų bugneliai. Tai, kodėl jos klausotės? Man feisbukas nesiūlo kitos. Vyras atsistoja ir surėkia. Mes visi galime jums padėti! Ar ne taip? Troleibuse kyla sambrūzdis. Dabar taip. Aš paimu iš šitos moters telefoną, o jūs jos feisbuke palaikinate savo mėgstamą atlikėją. Moteris kažką bando sakyti. Nusiraminkite. Aš profesionalas. Mes sugriausime jūsų algoritmus. Po dešimties minučių troleibuse tyla. Moteris klausosi muzikos su ausinėmis. Prie vyro prieina kitas vyriškis:</p><p>– O gal žinote, kaip ant dujinės nustatyti laikrodį? Niekaip nepavyksta.</p><p>***</p><p>Apsipirkinėju savitarnoje. Girdžiu kaip apsauginis rėkia ant paauglio. Kiek tu čia laiko stovėsi? Krauk greičiau savo tuos čipsus ir eik lauk. Nesikišu. Aš internete sąskaitas suvedinėju. Vieni kviečia į lauką išeiti pakalbėti. Aš kviečiu į internetą. Ateisi į internetą – tau šakės. Penkias valandas tavo laiko sudaužysiu kaip uogą. Komentarai yra mano ringas. Laiko nokdaunas. Supratot. Paauglys kažką pabamba ir išeina. Pažiūriu į apsauginį ir suprantu, kad nėra šansų, kad jis ateis pas mane į komentarus. Nusprendžiu pasiteirauti. Atsiprašau, o kiek laiko turiu prie savitarnos? Šypsosi jis man. Taigi suaugęs žmogus esi. Nesupratau, o ką tai bendro turi stovėjimu prie kasos? Dabar juk prakaitavimo metas. Nesvarbu ar su striuke ar su megztiniu išeisi į lauka – suprakaituosi. Tie paaugliai iš mokyklos atbėga į parduotuvę ir dar labiau suprakaitavę išbėga į lauką. Ir paskui peršąla. Snargliuojasi. Bandžiau jiems draugiškai paaiškinti. Be šansų. Tai reikia parėkti. Išėjau nieko nepasakęs. Tik namie atsidaręs feisbuką prie draugų pasiūlymų radau apsauginį. Nekviesiu. Tegul saugo paauglius. Linkiu nesusirgti.</p></body></html>	Naktinis darbas be trikdžių.

Paskui dar 4 kartus ėjau pati viena, vienuolikmetė, žiūrėti to didingo ir ašaringo reginio, dar kokius 10kart vėliau žliumbiau žiūrėdama per TV, tebeturiu storą papkę su iškarpom iš laikraščių, nes anuomet niekas netingėjo rašyti apie DiCaprio ir apie populiariausią visų laikų (iki tol) filmą.</p><p><a href="https://titanic.pl/">Parodos Varšuvoje</a> (veiks iki metų galo) atsiliepimai vidutiniški, manau, dėl to, kad daug kas tikėjosi parodos apie DiCaprio. Kiti gal manė pamatysiantys išskirtinę laivo prabangą ir auksines suknias. Bet paroda rimta, tikėjausi paskutinės salės, skirtos reprezentacijai filmuose ir kt., bet net tokio pataikavimo nebuvo.

Už ~30 eur išklausiau 7 labai skirtingų koncertų. Nostalgiškai prisiminiau prieš 15 m. Lenkų kultūros namuose (Vilniuje) vykdavusius <a href="https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.LT">apdovanojimus A.LT</a>, kur vienoje scenoje pasirodydavo visų ne-pop stilių muzikos atstovai. Varšuvoje taip pat buvo įdomu stebėti publiką, atstovaujančią visoms tebeegzistuojančios ir nykstančioms subkultūroms, nuo senų reiverių iki jaunų metalistų, bei tiesiog paprastam visavalgiam žmogui kaip aš.</p><p>Taip pat galvojau apie tai, kad pas mus avangardas suprantama kaip kažkas labai rimto, avangardinė muzika skamba kokiam nors ŠMC, „Jaunos muzikos“ festivalyje ar bent jau „Vilnius Jazz“. Lenkiškasis renginio konceptas buvo be jokio elitizmo, koncertai vyko toliau nuo centro, industriniuose klubuose/baruose/skylėse.

Atlikėja su zombio linzėm vaikščiojo tarp publikos ir prikišdama arti veidą gąsdino vyrus (kažkodėl jų publikoj buvo daugiau). Visgi saugi performanso riba nebuvo peržengta, visi liko pakutenti, su nejaukiom šypsenėlėm, buvo daug ką pafilmuoti, bet muzikinio ir idėjinio turinio lyg ir neįžvelgiau.

Koncerte buvo galima įsitikinti tiesa, kad gamtoje nėra garsiau klykiančio gyvūno už paauglę mergaitę. Stereotipiškai atrodantys vyrai čia buvo nebent tėčiai arba apsauginiai. Tikrai keistas pojūtis būti minioj, kurioj visi ne aukštesni už mane.</p><p>Marie sirgo, sakė: „Šiandien dar su niekuo nekalbėjau, saugojau balsą, jūs pirmi, tai girdėsit daug nesąmonių.“ Atliko Billie Eilish dainos fragmentą su žodžiais <em>miau miau miaaauu</em>. Vieną kūrinį dedikavo „lenkiškai virtuvei“. O savo žavinga laisva laikysena scenoje priminė mūsiškę Beatrich ar mažutę mielą Courtney Love. Buvo atliktas ir publikos praskyrimo stebuklas (žr. klipą), kai Marie atsiduria minios epicentre.

Graphs. Lambo photos. Banking stories. Such a huge snoozer. Whenever people ask me what books to read about money it’s hard. But one book I read in the last 24 months blew my mind:</p><p><em>“How To Live”</em> by Derek Sivers. It doesn’t seem like a book about money but it is.</p><p>Here’s what you can learn from it.</p><h1><strong>The biggest money lesson from </strong><em>“How To Live”</em></h1><p>I always hated when people made lots of money.</p><p>I loved to throw mud at billionaires while sipping a one-dollar 7-Eleven coffee. Then Derek Sivers said this:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Making money is nothing more than a neutral exchange of value. Making money is proof you're adding value to people's lives. Aiming to get rich is aiming to be useful to the world."</em></p></blockquote><p>Making money is helping people.</p><p>When someone makes a lot of money it means they’ve helped a lot of people, and you should at least shake their hand. You should probably also try to learn something from them. Only closed-minded losers shame wealthy people.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>"Making money isn't evil, greedy, shallow, or vain. Your biggest obstacle to getting rich is the harmful meaning you've attached to it."</p></div><h1>Money doesn’t give a f*ck about these things…</h1><blockquote><p><em>"Money doesn't care about your:</em></p><p><em>• Race</em></p><p><em>• Gender</em></p><p><em>• Education</em></p><p><em>• Physique</em></p><p><em>• Family</em></p><p><em>• Nationality</em></p><p><em>Anyone can be rich – so it might as well be you."</em></p></blockquote><p>I suspect this one will blow up a few people’s brains.</p><p>We’re taught by society to be victims. To blame our money problems on a 3rd party or even politicians. But no president is going to save you or your bank account. They’re busy building theirs and enjoying their newfound status.</p><p>One of my good friends makes 7-figures (USD) a year. He comes from a poor village in Africa. He decided to change his family’s future.</p><p>The only thing stopping you getting wealthy are your bullsh*t excuses about why it can’t happen. Money has nothing to do with IQ, and everything to do with helpfulness.</p><h1>“If more information was the answer, we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs.”</h1><p>Most people drown in information. They think the information age is the future.</p><p>Wrong. It’s the past. AI screwed the information age in the butt. We’re now drowning in information. Amazon is filled with AI-written books. Social media has AI sludge all over it. Our email inboxes are the next target for AI.</p><p>What a lot of people are missing is more action.</p><p>Taking what you’ve already learned and putting it to good use. Consuming more information is often nothing more than procrastination in disguise. It’s why my academy now offers execution instead of information.</p><p>Get around other people with the same goal. Take daily action.</p><h1>"Ideas are worth almost nothing.</h1><h1>Execution is everything. The world is filled with ideas, yet so few take action and make them happen."</h1><p>I met someone recently who had an idea for an AI marketplace.</p><p>They didn’t want to talk about it. They wanted me to sign an NDA. I told them “no one gives a f*ck about another AI chatbot idea. There’s nothing unique here, just like Uber but for boats isn’t a genius idea (a bank customer once wanted me to sign an NDA over this idea, too…LOL).</p><p>Investors and banks don’t invest in ideas. They invest in execution.</p><p>Do you have any results? Do you have customers? Have you earned any money from it? That’s the hard part.</p><p>We don’t value Elon Musk because he had a great idea of sending rockets to Mars. We value him because he sent rockets to space and saved real astronauts who were stranded.</p><p>Become an action-taker to get wealthy. Throw your ideas in the bin. What I learned is that dumb ideas often make the most money – life is a paradox.</p><h1>“The purpose of <strong>money</strong> is to trade for things that make you happy.</h1><h1>So if you can bypass <strong>money</strong> and get directly to the happy, you've saved a lot of trouble.”</h1><p>Not needing stuff is a huge money hack.</p><p>My Honda Civic is 9 years old. She still drives like a dream. I could easily replace it with a Lambo 4WD tomorrow. Yet I don’t. I don’t need another car. I have zero desire for material possessions or status. So I don’t need to earn as much money to live, which means my freedom number is 10x lower than the average person.</p><p>It also means I can retire decades earlier than most corporate rats.</p><p>What I chase is happiness. My 1 year old daughter gives me all of that for the cost of new nappies and some Bluey books with the occasional cafe smoothie.</p><p>Money can make your life complicated or simple. Choose simple.</p><h1><strong>“We do so many things for money whether we need it or not”</strong></h1><p>The virtue-signalling unicorns in the West love to pretend they don’t work for money.</p><p>They think they’re too good for money. They’re special. They’re driven by purpose. They’re writing the novel for the love of it. They would never dare ‘monetize’ a hobby. How dare you!</p><p>I call bullsh*t.</p><p>We do things for money even if we don’t need money. Getting paid helps us feel like we’re not being exploited. Better yet…</p><pre><code>Money helps make our work better.</code></pre><p>When you get paid you can build a website, hire a virtual assistant, get a fancy book cover designed by a cartoonist, and buy software to make your productivity higher.</p><p>Never trust a person who says they don’t need money.</p><h1>"Making money is a skill. Learn it and practice it like you would any other."</h1><p>Some people spend their entire lives struggling with money.</p><p>I was that person too. What changed for me was when I realized making money is a skill. There’s an art to crafting offers, sending proposals, pricing your time, and gently persuading someone to get your help.</p><p>Instead of treating money as this mysterious thing you never have enough of, turn it into an art form with a set of skills attached that you can learn.</p><h1>"Don't buy too many things, too big of a house, or hire too many people.</h1><h1>Rich people who do this feel trapped and miserable. The less you buy, the more you're in control."</h1><p>As your wealth increases it’s tempting to buy more stuff.</p><p>I’m a fan of hiring people to get more of your time back and build leverage, but there’s a threshold where a team of people can become a huge burden.</p><p>Material possessions require maintenance. That needs more money. And every item occupies some mental bandwidth.</p><p>The less stuff you own, the less your stuff owns you.</p><h1>"The more something costs, the more people value it.</h1><h1>By charging more, you're actually helping them use it and appreciate it."</h1><p>How you price your products and services is psychological, too.</p><p>Some people accidentally accept a low salary because they don’t know their own value. They think they have to be the lowest-cost option to get the job.</p><p>What I found when I applied for new jobs is the higher I told them my expected salary was the more seriously they wanted to hire me. A $300K a year salesperson sounds like they’d be better than a $50K a year one.</p><p>The same applies to business. I ran a $10K service and felt guilty for the high price tag. But the customers loved it because the cost forced them to take action and get results in 30 days.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>"Charge more than is comfortable to your current self-image. Value yourself higher, then rise to fit this valuation."</p></div><h1>"To get rich, don't think about what's valuable to you. Think about what's valuable to others."</h1><p>Selfish people are broke.</p><p>When it comes to making money they always think about their selfish desires and wants. They never think about how they can be helpful. This selfishness is a disease. It comes from the current <em>me, me, me</em> culture.</p><pre><code>Harsh truth: nobody gives a f*ck about you and what you want in life.</code></pre><p>We’re all thinking about ourselves. So put others ahead and you’ll be an uncommon mofo who’ll make more money than feels humanly possible. I never try to guess what is valuable in my business. I ask people. I survey them. I have Zoom calls with them.</p><p>Selflessness will make you wealthy.</p><h1>“Emotions are the enemy of good investing."</h1><p>The dumbest people I’ve ever met are day traders.</p><p>They don’t understand that it’s just gambling with a s*xier label. They often trade stocks, FX or crypto and even do courses to learn this magical skill.</p><p>Anyone who has worked in finance knows that buying &amp; selling any investment in the short term is gambling.</p><p>What screws day traders are their emotions.</p><p>It’s a constant high and low rollercoaster. Ultimately they lose every dollar… or they win the jackpot by accident and gamble it all back. Stay away from emotion-driven, short-term investing.</p><h1>“The world is full of money. There's no shortage. So capture the value you create. Charge for what you do."</h1><p>Money used to be scarce.</p><p>You were born in a country and the opportunities there defined your financial potential. If you grew up in a poor place you had to migrate to somewhere like America. It was complicated, expensive, and came with a waiting list.</p><p>Since the internet took over the planet everything has changed. It’s a borderless, global marketplace that’s open 24/7. We’re no longer limited by anything. And there are billions of dollars on the internet every day that are accessible to you.</p><p>The only limitation is whether you can attract that money to your life. That starts with ethically gaining some attention on social media, and choosing a half-decent business model.</p><p>The last one is key. Many people choose Uber slave driver income streams, like freelancing marketplaces, then wonder why their life turns to cr*ap.</p><p>Gain attention. Choose a digital income stream that’s proven to make cash. Then tell your old 9-5 boss to stick their job where the sun don’t shine (proud to have done this).</p><h1>"The world needs more boldness.</h1><h1>Refuse the comfortable addiction of a steady paycheck."</h1><p>The comfortable life is a nightmare.</p><p>It leads to mediocrity that pays the worst. You face high competition and the constant threat of the layoff boogie monster that’ll bite your titties off.</p><p>I have no problem with people starting with a paycheck. What’s sad is when it ends there. The bold thing to do is go out on your own and have multiple employers (customers). It forces you to stay sharp and add value. You can’t get lost in a big organization or hide behind a department for cover and free pizza.</p><p>Since I quit my job in 2021 my skills have increased by at least 100x. I’ve spent wild amounts of money on coaching, masterminds, courses, and events that have helped me gain new micro skills.</p><p>In banking, my only skill was order-taking (sales) and perhaps sending a few emails to customers with transaction fees on them.</p><p>Choose the path of growth and discomfort if you want to be wealthy.</p><h1>"Nothing destroys money faster than seeking status."</h1><p>I met a guy a few months back. Nice fellow. I wrote about him in another Substack.</p><p>He bought a BMW. He felt incredible. But the status cost him $3000 a month plus 15% a year in interest on the loan. If he invested that money in a business he would probably have quit his job by now.</p><p>When he handed over the cash to the German car company, everything at work was great. Now it isn’t. A new boss started. They micro-manage him. They took away his 6-figure bonus. Chasing status is stupid. The richest people look ordinary.</p><p>Real status is the free time to do whatever the F you want.</p><h1><strong>Closing Thought</strong></h1><p>I strongly recommend you read “How To Live.” It will change your financial life.</p><p>What’s your favorite money idea above from Derek?</p><p><em>This article is for informational purposes only, it should not be considered financial, tax or legal advice.

Ta prasme tikroji grupė Lietuvoje grojo pernai, o kitąmet pasirodys Taline. Tribute’as reklamuojamas taip: „įspūdingiausias 2024 metų pasaulinis turas!“ (čia lyginant su Taylor Swift?), „Tapk XXI a. muzikinės istorijos dalimi!!!“ (tokiam konce jei kuo ir tapsi, tai nebent kriminalinės istorijos dalimi).</p><p>Sunku suvokti, kodėl kas nors norėtų eiti į aktyvios ir Europoje koncertuojančios grupės tribute’ą. Na, taip, bilietas tik 30 eurų, bet autobusas iki Varšuvos – vos 20 eurų. Kažkiek dar galėjau suprast visokius TABAMI goes Queen, kur 2008 m. Mantas Jankavičius plėšydavosi su priklijuotais ūsais. Skurdūs buvo laikai, ir muzikaliai, ir finansiškai. Nors, tiesą pasakius, ir tada, atsimenu, užsidegus aiškindavau draugams, kad Lietuvos muzikantai yra tinginio pančiai ir nieko patys nebekuria, tik pelnosi iš žymaus vardo, kad čia tas pats kaip Kelias į žvaigždes ir kad šimtąkart geriau įrašą namuose įsijungt, negu klausyt, kaip Skampai Brodvėjuje dainuoja Nirvaną. </p><p>Keista, kad dabar ši tema vėl aktuali. Matyt, visgi nostalgija yra akinanti ir kurtinanti jėga. Todėl Vilniuje galėsim išvysti „Europe’s No. 1 Guns N’ Roses tribute band“ Reckless Roses (Ambrazevičiaus <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pambrazevicius/posts/pfbid02BbxBfktUXGoTzbmCSLXrKXxrPFQFvRyFPZLeNsMyAex4SwCuprvES61DyXhKwnD3l?rdid=6FRbHmLqroc9SNiV">fb įraše</a> rasit daugiau smagesnių pasiūlymų tribute grupių pavadinimams). Kitą savaitę pasirodys L1NKN P4RK (The Linkin Park Experience), nors ką tik ir pati po mirties atgimusi grupė tapo savo pačių tribute’u, pakvietę moterį, pakopijuoti a.a. Chesterį. Ne ne, čia tikrai ne dėl pinigų, tiesiog muzikantai savo malonumui tūkstančius kartų groja savo senus hitus. Ne ne, pavadinimas grupės tas pats tikrai vien iš pagarbos. Kurkit ką nors kita, eksperimentuokit, dėl dievo, nekopijuokit savęs pačių.</p><p>Na, ir kaipgi be AC/DC Tribute Show with Symphony Orchestra (Compensoj). AC/DC surogatai pas mus turi ilgametę tradiciją su vietine Barniškio-Blėkos grupe ir atsidavusių diedų gerbėjų. </p><p>Dar vienas smagesnis renginukas – „Roko amžius: arena show“, aplankysiantis Kauno, Klaipėdos ir Šiaulių arenas, tik Vilniuj kažkaip kukliai - Compensoj. Tiesiog svajonės išsipildymas – Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Bon Jovi, Vidas Bareikis, Liepa Mondeikaitė, ak!..</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg" width="404" height="587.6363636363636" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:404,&quot;bytes&quot;:169919,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd18a150-af4a-4453-b543-38f93649b028_550x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Beje, lenkai neatsilieka, per arenas netrukus keliaus konceptualus koncertas, kuriame vietinės žvaigždės scenoje gadins visas jums brangias melodijas.

Nominantus renka virš 7000 asmenų. „Cowboy Carter“ tapo pirmuoju juodaodės moters albumu, pasiekusiu pirmąją vietą Billboard country albumų sąraše. Soc. medijose albumą pagyrė Michelle Obama ir Kamala Harris. Tačiau albumo dainos buvo retai grojamos country radijo stotyse. Beje, spėjama, kad albumo atsiradimą įkvėpė tie patys Country apdovanojimai 2016 m., kuriuose Beyoncé pasirodė su Dixie Chicks ir „did not feel welcomed“. Kritikai ir fanai albumą priėmė kaip duoklę primirštam juodaodžių indėliui į country muzikos kultūrą, tačiau pati karalienė sakė: „This is a ‘Beyoncé’ album.“</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h4>Pokalbiai</h4></blockquote><p>Džiugu, kad atsiranda vis daugiau įdomesnių, vertingesnių pokalbių, ne vien tų vienadienių „kodėl taip pasivadinote? kas įkvepia kūrybai? ką norėjote pasakyti šiuo albumu?“ Į nepaprastą, ramią, filosofišką, nepretenzingą, atmosferą (gal dėl to, kad prieš miegą klausiau) įtraukė Karolio Vyšniausko pokalbis su <strong>Emilija Karosaite</strong> (rašiau apie jos puikų debiutinį albumą „Aprašykime albumą“, kuris dabar dar labiau pagerėjo; štai nuoroda).</p><p></p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;4fb45f82-f6f8-4c36-8f14-fc05e247f0a2&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(I) Laidoje „Ne vienas“ Tomas Narkevičius kaip visada įžvalgiai ir atvirai reflektavo save ir savo kūrybą.

Tiek vargšas Džiovanis keiksnojamas, kad man jau net norisi protestuot, priešintis inercijai ir sakyt, kad nugi nieko jis blogo nedaro. Tokias mintis sustiprino <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV9c7YZJeeI&amp;t=4371s&amp;ab_channel=Lietuvosnacionalinisradijasirtelevizija">Zilnio pokalbis su Nainiu</a>, kur šis savo firminiu itin ramiu ir mandagiu tonu gana blaiviai vertina savo kūrybą ir kitų požiūrį į ją. Įspūdingiausia, kai savo kūrybą palygina su greito maisto restoranu. Taip pat keliskart kartoja, kad „savo temoj, tiems žmonėms, kuriems aš groju, aš tikrai moku padaryt gerą laiką“, „daug darbo įdedu, kad žmonės gautų šventę“.</p><p>Kiek tragikomiškiau skamba pasakojimas apie Jovanio apsilankymą Opiume, kai kažkas jį pasiuntė nx („nors man gi gali visokia muzika patikt“), ir jo atsakas kritikams: „Kaip aš galiu nemokėt grot, jei tą esu daręs jau tūkstančius valandų.“ Na, čia iškyla terminologinis klausimas – ką vadinsime grojimu. Ar melodijos atitaikymą prie vizulkių ekrane galime vadinti grojimu? Slidi ta riba, tarp elektroninės muzikos kūrybos, senų pamirštų kūrinių remiksavimo, prikėlimo naujam gyvenimui, ir – naudojimosi kitų kūryba savo materialinio pralobimo tikslais.</p><p>Ta riba slidinėja ir Jovani savo albume, kuris man turbūt labiausiai nepatinka tuo, kad Jovani vardas rašomas pirmiau originalaus kūrinio atlikėjų. Juk jeigu būtų užrašyta Jurga „Nebijok“ (Jovani remix), viskas būtų kaip ir aišku ir neįdomu. </p><p>Tokio albumo, kuriame patiuninguotos senos (pagyvenusios) lietuviškos dainos, motyvaciją Jovanis aiškina tuo, kad lietuviška muzika atgimė, vėl tapo įdomi, seni gabalai buvo įrašyti labai prasta kokybe, norisi, kad jie „skambėtų šiuolaikiškai“. Čia vėl terminologinis klausimas - kas tas šiuolaikiškai? Bet suprantu, kad didelei daliai žmonių patinka mašinoj įsijungt gerą ritmuką. Be to, kaip pasakoja Nainys, visiems šiems autoriams buvo paskambinta, visi jie sutiko bendradarbiauti ir galimai netgi pasirodys Jovani Arena Show. Tikrai galiu sutikt dėl prastos Junior ar Ledi Ais įrašų kokybės. Tos dainos tikrai nusipelno ir antro, ir trečio gyvenimo. Bet ar tas pats galioja Jurgai ir Lemon Joy? Taip pat kažkaip nemalonu matyti, kad šitie Jovanio remiksai dabar perklausomis prilygsta arba lenkia originalus.</p><p>Taip pat nuvilia, kad albume net trys Junior gabalai – turbūt su jais geriausiai pavyko suvaibint. Bet jei jau daroma tokia lietuviško pop kompiliacija, norėtųsi jos įvairesnės. Kur Ekspreso „Pirmoji naktis“? Kur Dinamika? </p><p>Prasmingiausiai, žinoma, skamba du gabalai su Remio Retro repu, nes nuo remikso priartėja prie koverio. Dar patiko Tajos „Jūra“ (gal todėl, kad neatsimenu originalo). </p><p>Ai, dar interviu patiko Jovanio <em>rantas </em>apie tai, kad užuot piktinęsi ir bjauriai apie jį komentavę, geriau parašykit žinutę, „galėsi manim pasinaudot, aš tau duosiu visą savo auditoriją, galėsim sukolabint“. Kaip pats pripažino, gal ir naivus požiūris, bet visgi gražus. Jei komercinis požiūris jums nesvetimas.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>(II) NOTE LITHUANIA: Jazz 2024</strong></p><iframe class="spotify-wrap playlist" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://image-cdn-ak.spotifycdn.com/image/ab67706c0000d72cfff8f60888060ec58ac7d69d&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Note Lithuania: Jazz 2024&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By Greta Jakobsonaitė&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Playlist&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0f1cDsBQs6tApRCaFgTFZg&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0f1cDsBQs6tApRCaFgTFZg" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p>Spalio 16–20 d. vyks turbūt labiausiai gerbiamas ir, mano akimis, labiausiai saugotinas Lietuvos festivalis – <a href="http://www.vilniusjazz.lt/">Vilnius Jazz</a>. Ne vienus metus esu ten save edukavus, nes programoje visada galima rasti ir ausų nelaužančio klasikinio džiazo, ir beprotiško avangardo, ir Lietuvos džiazo istorijos, ir naujokų, ir tolimų, ir artimų kraštų. Tai ten siūlau eiti.</p><p>O taipogi siūlau susipažinti su Lietuvos muzikos informacijos centro atrinktais pastarųjų poros metų įdomiausiais džiazo kūriniais. Rinktinė sumanyta skatinti muzikos sklaidai užsienyje, bet tikrai turėtų būti labiau pasitelkiama ir sklaidai Lietuvoje. Rinktinė įvairiažanrė, įvairiastilė ir įvairiainstrumentė, nuo mylimų Sheep Got Waxed iki didelių tarptautinių ansamblių.</p><p>Apskritai Note Lithuania rinkiniai man atrodo neįkainojamos vertės. (Dalį jų galite rasti <a href="https://www.mic.lt/lt/grotuvas/">MIC grotuve</a>. O visą krūvą seniausių, nuo 2007 m., <a href="https://www.pakartot.lt/project/note-lithuania">rasite Pakartot</a>. Labai norėtųsi, kad jie visi taptų patogiai prieinami vienoj vietoj.) Juose galima matyti lietuviškos muzikos, atskirų jos žanrų, kaitą bėgant metams. Prisiminti, pavyzdžiui, kaip 2007 m. muzikos būta tiek mažai, kad rinkinyje buvo apjungtos „pop/rock“ kategorijos, ir kaip net Riaubiškytė (buvo ir ji) dainavo angliškai.</p><p>Tiesa, dar patikslinsiu, kad dabar kūriniai komisijos atrenkami iš atsiųstų paraiškų, t. y. čia nebūtinai rasite kokį nors akivaizdų atlikėją, nes jis tiesiog nedalyvavo konkurse. Tačiau galit rasti kokį nors visai nežinomą, kuris nepatingėjo dalyvauti. <a href="https://emilijaviso.substack.com/p/menesio-suktinis">Čia pernai rašiau</a> apie Note Lithuania eksperimentikos rinkinį.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>(III) JAZZU „Keisti ženklai“</strong></p><iframe class="spotify-wrap album" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2734e709a992173730d57a8c82e&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Keisti Ženklai&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;Jazzu&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Album&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/1QcYd3zOjvXO3ZYGJ71Umw&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1QcYd3zOjvXO3ZYGJ71Umw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p>Labai man graži dramatiška daina „Išgėriau išrūkiau“, kur nerūpestingu tonu pasakojama apie galimai toksiškus buvusius santykius. Panašų naratyvą kitais žodžiais pasakoja ir „Vilkolakis“. Albumai gal nėra stipriausia Jazzu pusė. Ir šis nėra vientisas (nepadeda ir pridėti intro bei outro), labiau paremtas atskirais hitais (puikiu lengvabūdišku duetu su Gamka). Šiek tiek cringe’o sukėlė kūrinys „Garsiai ploju sau“, kuriame iš tiesų yra sau plojama. Vis dėlto iš Jazzu neatimsi išlavintos poptekstų rašymo rankos.</p><p>Žinau, kad daug ką atstumia Jazzu manieros, bet manau, kad labai svarbu vertinti jos talentą bei ilgametę stabilią karjerą. Nedaug teturim tokio ryškumo bei įtakingumo moterų, o tokią divą su jos pliusais ir minusais apskritai teturim vieną. Dukart teko būti Jazzu ir Somovo areniniuose koncertuose, kurie įsiminė įspūdingu Justės, kaip atlikėjos, talentu, ne tik vokaliniu, bet ir emociniu.

Kaip bėga laikas. Pavadinimas „Dievas pervertintas“ grąžina prie pirmojo - „Dievo nuleisti“. Ir pasakoja, kaip Kristus randamas kažkokiam afteryje Rusijoje. Kaip patys sakė LRT Opus, „anksčiau kastruodavom gražulius, dabar kastruojam šventuosius“. Tai tokie reikaliukai. McLoudai tęsia savo provokacijas, kurios visgi lieka pasižaidimo, pasilinksminimo lygmeny ar bent taip yra priimamos jaunos publikos. Jei būtų kiti laikai, gal visi drauge sudegintų kokio politiko mašiną. Dabar gi grupė sako: „Lietuva eina į priekį, nes mes šią vasarą gyvenam iš miesto švenčių.“ Šitas paradoksalus faktas mane ir džiugina (dėl to, kad regionai sulaukia šiek tiek daugiau šiek tiek įvairesnės muzikos nei anksčiau), ir kartu kažkaip liūdina.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>(V) NOYUS „Salva Xalva“</strong></p><div class="bandcamp-wrap album" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noyus.bandcamp.com/album/salva-xalva&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Salva Xalva, by Noyus&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;9 track album&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e2f4547-5b8e-411a-af10-451299627cf4_700x700.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Noyus&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1718871262/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=small/transparent=true/&quot;,&quot;is_album&quot;:true}" data-component-name="BandcampToDOM"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1718871262/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/artwork=small/transparent=true/" frameborder="0" gesture="media" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>Jei ieškote švelnaus skambesio, liūdno šokio, queer pop ar tiesiog įkvėpimo savarankiškai kurti, Noyus įrašė labai asmenišką, trapų albumą apie vienatvę, meilės ieškojimą ir bijojimą, geismą ir atsiribojimą.

Lietuvos muzikos žemėlapyje grupė nariais dalinasi su Motina, Keista bjauria žuvim, Tureto sindromu – tai vien iš šių grupių skirtingumo galima susidaryt įspūdį apie Plié chaotiškumą, teatrališkumą ir Death Gripsiškumą. </p><p>Patinka ironiškas albumo pavadinimas ir apskritai pats faktas, kad kažkas skiria laiką ir energiją būtent tokiai kūrybai, praskiedžiančiai, prapjaunančiai tai, kas lengva, malonu, standartiška.</p><p>Rekomenduoju D.

Čia ir postrokas, ir tūžmingos Nick Cave’iškos raudos, ir smuiko dejonės, ir savotiška intensyvi, energinga apatija (lot. <em>acedia </em>– apatija, abejingumas).

Todėl turime per daug kultūros leidinių, per mažai skaitytojų ir vidutinišką kokybę. Ir tuomet amžinas “Litmenis” susiima ir pasikviečia “Le Monde”, uždraudžia sau rašyti, išverčia pastarųjų metų kelis prancūzų ilgaskaičius ir šitas bendras numeris staiga užgroja.

Joje sutinkame mokslo haliucinacijų paraštes, kuomet suvokimas kaip viskas veikia ima sprogdinti iš vidaus, kai prieštaraujančios sąvokos sugyvena, matematika tampa poezija, fizikoje svarbsta elegantiškumas, išradimai naikina ir gelbėja žmoniją kone vienu metu, o beprotybė ir aštrus protas susikabina rankomis. BL kyšteli savo talentą išversti ir ištransliuoti nepasiekiamus mokslo laiptus į pirmiausiai, žmogiškąją dramą.

Pasirinkau legendinio <em>noir</em> žanro augintojo Jeano Pierre Melville lėtas, mažaemoces, tylias gaudynes “Raudonasis ratas”. Jame tūno ir nuostabi, 27 minutes trunkanti plėšimo scena be jokių žodžių, cigarete nei burna kalbantis Delono banditėlis, siurrealistiniai demonų egzorcizmai ir voriškas policijos tinklas. Ai, ir vidurinis pirštas skubiems neftlixo <em>crime </em>serialiukams.</p><div><hr></div><h4><em>Projektas:</em> Pasakykite Anai kokia bus naujienų ateitis</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg" width="1456" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4018687,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe54a10ab-c863-414a-abba-9ff801179f5e_2551x1402.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Per vasarą nelabai įdegiau, bet kartu su A-komanda užkūrėme Aną, naujienų asistentę, kuri nepailstamai dirba naujienų surinkimo, atrinkimo, esmės išrašymo, personalizavimo darbus.

Tai — beveik kasdieniai atsitiktines temas, bet neatsitiktinius personažus įsileidžiantys Kareem Rahma micro-intervai Niujorke, pavadinti “Subway Takes”. Formatas paprastas ir todėl toks geras: Kareemas pasisodina pašnekovą ir klausia: “So, what’s your take?”. Tada suteikia sekundžių savo tezei išdėstyti, tarkim: mergvakariai yra šlamštas, ilgaauliai batai vasarą — košmaras, prievarta metro — labai gerai taksistams, riebaus pieno negėrimas suminkštino žmones.

Ten verda rimti dalykai. Vienas jų: <a href="https://mo.lt/ivykiai/lietuvos-meno-paroda-paryziuje/">MO ir Pompidou partnerystė</a>. Keliolika lietuvių menininkų jau eksponuojami ir po to bus perleisti (arba jau įsigyti) bei nusipelnys vietos nuolatinėje Pompidou kolekcijoje. </p><p>Antras jų: “Kūrybingumo mokyklos” iniciatyva nufilmuotas Linos Lapelytės Baltijos kelio pavertimas šiurpiaode muzika. Būsima auditorija taps keli milijonai prancūzų moksleivių, bet ir mūsų jauniesiems tai gros nemažiau gražiai. Nors su “KūMo” esu susijęs esmingai, dalis projektų vyksta be manęs ir šį stebėjau kaip žiūrovas. Ir koks entuziastingas! Bus dar dvi pamokos su Manfredu ir b-girl Nicka. Bet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMB-_SiXRDA">pirmiausiai išgirskite Linos įgarsintą pavydėtiną baltijiečių drąsą.</a></p><p>Pasisekė prancūzams — kiek LT muzikos bus išgrota, spektaklių, parodų išeksponuota, paskaitų, pranešimų prasukta, ar “Magnetinės dainavos” silkės išragauta.

Paskutinysis epizodas apmąsto svaigulį. Svaigulys — įdomiai lietuviškai skambanti būsena. Jis yra kažkas už normalybės ribų. Lyg nesusipratimas amžinoje ramybinėje normalybėje. “Svaigulys” lietuviškai sako, kad kažkas sukasi, nėra stabilu, juda, mainosi. Jis tarsi susuka galvą, sujaukia protą, sumakaluoja mintis. Juk yra įprastybė ir yra svaigulys. Tvarka ir chaosas. Namas ir jį supurtantis žemės drebėjimas.</p><p>Lenkiuosi visiems skyrusiems laiko: Giedriui ir LRT, kurie patikėjo žalia idėja, idealiems pašnekovams, garsą meistravusiam Kristupui, idėją įkalbėjusiai Ulai ir jums, kurie klausėte.

This idea sounds like clickbait Alex Hormozi garbage to the masses.</p><p>It feels like it’s time to roll out the cliche “Do what you love little Timmy Tucker.” Over the last few years I’ve turned my life into a video game. The only objective of this game is I want to keep playing it forever.</p><p>That means I need to continue to get paid to play this game. The difference here is I’m not doing the work I do to earn money or get rich. I just want to keep doing this type of work that feels like play to me.</p><p>It’s a radical mindset that blows up most people’s brains.</p><p>I didn’t invent this way of life, and I stumbled across it by pure accident. Here’s how you, too, can get paid to play and experience what is the best feeling in the world.</p><h1>Don’t play stupid games with stupid people</h1><p>The most important goals always start with figuring out what you don’t want (also known as anti-goals).</p><p>I used to spend my days in meeting rooms playing stupid games with stupid people. I never got anything done. Even changing a logo on a sales page required a committee of pinheads to agree.</p><p>I’d wake up and answer stupid work emails that a chatbot could easily answer. I’d sell stupid bank products that I didn’t agree with to stupid people who thought these products would make them rich (banking products make the bank rich, not you).</p><p>I disliked most people I met in business. They were so mediocre.</p><p>They’d have Friday drinks, get drunk, watch the football, and talk about some meaningless Netflix show. It all felt so … boring. I accepted this boredom as my reality. I’d never known any other way to live.</p><p>My life felt stupid.</p><p>I eventually got off this hamster wheel. I discovered that people were building new careers for themselves on the internet with no boss and no employer. It seemed like clickbait at the start until I was surrounded by an army of people living this way.</p><p>They chose a topic, made it their obsession, then centered their whole life around it. I discovered they turned their life into a video game.</p><h1>Get paid to keep playing the video game you obsess over</h1><p>Once I succeeded at online writing it was all I wanted to do.</p><p>When I quit my 9-5 job the stakes became higher. My mantra became, “How do I keep getting paid to play this amazing video game?” It wasn’t a game of survival or trying to become a rich b*tch so I could buy a Lambo and take selfies in Santa Monica.</p><p>I just wanted to keep living the video game…</p><ul><li><p>Wake up whenever</p></li><li><p>See my daughter whenever</p></li><li><p>Goof off a day a week</p></li><li><p>Walk in the sunshine</p></li><li><p>Hit the gym 4 times a week (whenever)</p></li><li><p>Work from home or an Airbnb anywhere in the world</p></li><li><p>Never get told what to do by a micro-managing boss ever again</p></li><li><p>Write every day without filtering who I am or worrying about opinions</p></li></ul><p>So I set up my online business to do that.</p><p>This meant I had to…</p><ol><li><p>Find predictable income streams</p></li><li><p>Make money from my strengths</p></li><li><p>Find ways to make recurring revenue</p></li><li><p>Learn how to craft high-ticket offers ($10,000+)</p></li><li><p>Build affiliate partnerships</p></li><li><p>Grow my email list</p></li><li><p>Figure out how to get predictable traffic to my email list</p></li></ol><p>These seven steps allowed me to set up a foundation to keep getting paid for the rest of my life. It’s the kind of feeling I can’t describe. I’m 100% self-sufficient and will never ask an employer for a salary again. It’s what I call the permissionless life.</p><p>Here are the steps if you want to do the same.</p><h1>1. Turn an “interest” into an obsession</h1><p>There’s a threshold of participation most people never reach.</p><p>It’s easy to get h0rny when you’re in the virgin territory of a new interest. Those first few weeks of a new interest are orgasmic. But after the endorphins wear off the average person can’t keep the habit of an interest long enough to get results.</p><p>They need dopamine. They need the ear candy of compliments and strangers kissing their smelly feet to keep going.</p><p>The only way to overcome this “interest” problem is to dial up the intensity. </p><p>I call it “going all in.” You must fully commit. </p><ul><li><p>For some people that means quitting their job. </p></li><li><p>For others it means giving up all their other hobbies. </p></li><li><p>In my case it meant dumping my ex-girlfriend so I could get rid of all BS distractions and focus on online writing.</p></li></ul><p>It also means putting ya money where ya big mouth is.</p><p><em>Interest</em> is hard to maintain. When you invest money in an interest you start to expect an ROI. That gives you leverage on your lazy self (a side we all have) to wake up early and actually put in the work.</p><p>No money, no commitment.</p><p>Interests need to peculate for long enough too. The 10,000-hour rule is a good rule of thumb. But doing the same thing over and over and expecting results is the definition of insanity. The 10,000-hour rule also needs 10,000 iterations.</p><p>To dial up the intensity to the max you also need to be around other people on their way to obsession who care about similar things. Obsession is an identity. It’s not for everyone, but without it you stay a no one.</p><p>Go all in or don’t get paid to play. Ever.</p><blockquote><p><em>Obsession turns average people into outliers – Zach Pogrob</em></p></blockquote><h1>2. Value growth more than you value safety</h1><p>I spoke to a guy today.</p><p>His email started with “I’m obsessed.” He then went on to tell me he’s only willing to explore his obsession if it’s free. He won’t invest in anything from anyone. I suggested a $100 option he could try from a creator I admire. He still wouldn’t do it.</p><pre><code>If you won’t invest $100 in your obsession, you’re not obsessed.</code></pre><p>You’re lying to yourself. Where we invest money helps us to understand what we care about. Mastery in any field isn’t free.</p><p>(For some reason people will pay $100K for a mostly useless college degree though.) What stops us investing in our obsession is we’re taught to value safety more than we are to take risks.</p><pre><code>An investment always carries some risk but so, too, does playing it safe.</code></pre><p>People spend so much time trying to protect the little they already got, that they miss out on the enormous upside they could have by investing in their obsession.</p><p><strong>Most people’s security blankets aren’t worth protecting.</strong> $20,000 in savings feels like a lot, but you can never really live an extraordinary life with it.</p><p>You’ll always be one step away from broke. One curveball. One medical disaster. One parking fine. Bam. It’s all gone. Mayday, mayday. That’s no way to live.</p><p>Protecting the little you have is a sign of a scarcity mindset. Obsession is fuelled by a growth mindset grounded in optimism.</p><p>You must believe life can be better than it is to truly get paid to play for the rest of your life.</p><h1>3. Get so good people pay you</h1><p>Work that feels like play doesn’t turn into money until you get good.</p><p>In my case, there are a lot of writers online. Anyone can write. But most never get paid to do it every day because they don’t master the video game. Like anything, there are a stack of micro skills needed to go beyond the average results most will achieve.</p><p>On the surface it looks like all you need to do is write. Once you get far enough into the game you realize there’s 100x more to it.</p><p>At this point you can either get overwhelmed and frustrated by it, or you can play the game and push yourself to mastery.

Today we report the first topline results of a project we are collaborating on focused on better understanding the views of ordinary Americans on energy and climate. We present the eye-opening highlights of a new detailed YouGov survey of Americans on climate and energy — a survey that we designed and conducted a few weeks ago. —RP</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>The future of the clean energy transition is cloudy. It’s well-known that there are disagreements—wide disagreements—between Republicans and Democrats about our energy future. But less well-known is the bedrock of public opinion on America’s energy supply, the importance of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, and the general salience of the climate change issue.</p><p>Findings from a new YouGov survey indicate that most voters’ views differ quite a bit from those of rapid energy transition advocates. These views constitute an ineluctable reality that any transition, on any timetable, will have to deal with. At the same time there is political opportunity here to better align policy priorities with voter preferences.</p><p>This survey is part of a broader study conducted by Roger Pielke, Jr. and Ruy Teixeira of the American Enterprise Institute that seeks to compare scientific understandings of energy and climate with dominant public narratives on these issues and how both compare to the views of actual voters.</p><p>The full study and polling data will be released after the election but here we present ten of the most interesting findings from our new survey that shed light on the current debate around climate and energy issues.</p><p>1. <em><strong>An "all of the above" approach to energy policy has by far the most voter support and shows remarkable stability and common support across voter groups</strong>.</em></p><p>When presented with a choice among three options—a rapid green energy transition, an “all of the above” energy policy, and emphasizing fossil fuels—American voters across demographics and partisanship strongly prefer an “all of the above” approach to energy policy including oil, gas, renewables, and nuclear. Less than a quarter support a rapid transition to renewables, which drops to under a fifth for working-class (noncollege) voters. Even among Democrats, support for a rapid transition is only a little over a third.</p><p>2. <em><strong>On extreme weather events, most voters have not accepted the apocalyptic reporting found in the media and pushed by climate activists</strong>.</em></p><p>Most people hold views of trends in extreme weather events that are consistent with the most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They do <em>not</em> say they have personally observed an increase in hurricanes, floods, drought, or tornadoes which is consistent with the current state of scientific understandings. The exception is heat waves where, consistent with the IPCC, a majority report that they have observed an increase in such events.</p><p>3. <em><strong>American voters are reluctant to pay even a small amount to support climate action and this willingness drops quickly as the proposed small costs increase</strong></em>.</p><p>When asked if they would support just a $1 monthly fee on their electricity bill to fight climate change, only 47 percent say they would while almost as many (43 percent) are opposed. Even at this level, opposition is greater than support among working-class voters. When the proposed fee is increased to $20, overall voter support plummets to 26 percent with 60 percent opposed. At $40, it is 19 percent support to 69 percent opposition; at $75 it is 15 percent vs. 72 percent; and at $100 it is 7:1 against (77 percent to 11 percent) paying such a fee to combat climate change.</p><p>4. <em><strong>Voters expect an energy transition away from fossil fuels to lead to unexpected problems</strong>.</em></p><p>About two-thirds think problems are likely. A follow-up question indicates that voters are most worried about the impact on the prices of energy and everyday goods and about the impact on the reliability of the electrical grid. Voters are most positive about the impact of an energy transition on job opportunities in the energy sector and on air and water quality.</p><p>5. <em><strong>Overall, the public is much more favorable on both solar and natural gas than on wind, suggesting that the concept of "renewables" masks some important differences</strong>.</em></p><p>Solar energy tests the best among five energy sources that voters were asked to rank. Thirty-eight percent of voters ranked solar first. Natural gas did the second best, picked first by 26 percent of voters. Nuclear energy came third (15 percent ranked it first) followed by wind (10 percent) and coal (6 percent). Coal is clearly the least preferred energy source with 38 percent ranking it dead last among options. Wind and nuclear also have strong opposition with, respectively, 19 percent and 29 percent ranking the technology their least favorite option.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NDM0MTg3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDk5ODA5MDcsImlhdCI6MTcyODU2NTU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzMxMTU3NTQ1LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjM5MDU4Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.0EkXBMnesXBGELGduAQzpEuYTW4rH7FPqE7uTIB4Gns&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NDM0MTg3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDk5ODA5MDcsImlhdCI6MTcyODU2NTU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzMxMTU3NTQ1LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjM5MDU4Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.0EkXBMnesXBGELGduAQzpEuYTW4rH7FPqE7uTIB4Gns"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>6. <em><strong>In terms of the energy they consume, cost and reliability are way, way more important to voters than possible effects on the climate</strong>.</em></p><p>Given four choices, 37 percent of voters said the cost of the energy they use was most important to them and 36 percent said the availability of power when they need it was most important. Just 19 percent thought the effect on climate of their energy consumption was most important and 6 percent selected the effect on U.S. energy security.</p><p>7. <em><strong>In terms of proposals to mitigate the effects of climate change, getting to “net zero” as quickly as possible is relatively unimportant to voters</strong>.</em></p><p>Asked to consider proposals to reduce the effects of global climate change, voters were least likely to say “getting the U.S. to net zero carbon emissions as quickly as possible” was very important to them personally (29 percent), fewer than said “limiting the burden of regulations on business” was very important (32 percent). Voters were most likely by far to say keeping consumer costs low (66 percent) and increasing jobs and economic growth (60 percent) were very important aspects of climate mitigation proposals. The split was wider among working-class voters: 71 percent thought keeping consumer costs low was very important, compared to 26 percent who thought rapidly getting to net zero was very important.</p><p>8. <em><strong>Climate change as an issue has very low salience to voters</strong>.</em></p><p>Voters were asked to evaluate a list of 18 issue areas and rate their priority for the president and Congress to address in the coming year. As a “top priority,” dealing with global climate change ranked 15<sup>th</sup> out of these 18 areas, well behind strengthening the national economy, fighting inflation, defending the country from terrorist attacks, and keeping Social Security financially sound—and also behind reducing health care costs, dealing with immigration, improving the educational system, keeping energy costs low, reducing the budget deficit, reducing crime, improving how the political system works, improving the job situation, strengthening the military, and dealing with the problems of poor people. The climate issue only ranked above global trade, drug addiction, and issues around race.</p><p>9. <em><strong>Voters support increased domestic production of fossil fuels, but they are unaware fossil fuel production has actually increased in the last several years</strong>.</em></p><p>By 22 points (56-34), voters favor more domestic production of fossil fuels—oil and gas. Working-class voters felt even more strongly, endorsing the idea by 30 points. But only 17 percent of voters are aware that the Biden administration has increased oil production on federal lands. However, when informed that the U.S. has, in fact, increased domestic production of oil and gas in the last several years, they are delighted. Almost seven in ten (69 percent) said “this is a positive development, which brings good jobs for U.S. workers, ensures our energy supply and helps the U.S. support our allies who need similar resources” compared to 31 percent who thought “this is a negative development, which brings more pollution, climate change, and continued reliance on fossil fuels.”</p><p>10. <em><strong>Voter interest in electric heat pumps, hot water heaters and stoves, as well as electric vehicles, is weak</strong>.</em></p><p>Asked whether they had given serious thought to making certain “green” changes in their home within the past 12 months, 75 percent of voters said they either had not given serious thought to installing an electric heat pump or that that device was not relevant to them; 67 percent said the same thing about an electric water heater as did 61 percent about an electric stove or induction system.</p><p>Voters by 17 points (52-35) say they are opposed to phasing out new gasoline cars and trucks by 2035 and many more voters are upset (48 percent) than excited (21 percent) by the idea of phasing out production of gas-powered cars and trucks. By 18 points (59-41), voters say they are not likely to even consider purchasing an electric vehicle as their next car. Just 10 percent say they now own an electric vehicle and two-thirds of those are hybrid rather than fully electric. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-clean-energy-transitions-voter/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>Thanks for reading and commenting!

No in between. That view of the world is a little harsh for my liking. As always the truth lies in the nuance.</p><p>I never used to see myself as a high performer. My younger years were full of failures. My childhood was too. We lost our family home not once but twice. Kids used to make fun of me.</p><p>In 2013 my entire world changed forever.</p><p>I went to a Tony Robbins seminar that rewired my brain. I started to think differently. That made me weird which made me feel good. For the last 11 years, I’ve been on the path of high performance and in the top 1% of my field.</p><p>High performers aren’t what they seem. You’ve been lied to.</p><h1>Lie #1 – There’s a lot of competition</h1><p>No there isn’t.</p><p>What I do is lonely because there isn’t any real competition. And when there is a competitor, they last about 6 months and then give up or go out of business.</p><p>When there’s no competition it feels lonely. You have no one to aspire to be like. It’s hard to find idols. What you do can even feel boring.</p><p>So the problem to solve isn’t that you’ll have so many competitors no one will pay attention to what you do. No. The problem is that you’ll discover there is no competition and feel lonely.</p><p>Learning to deal with the loneliness is not always easy, but it’s an attribute of obsessed people who chase their mission to its illogical conclusion.</p><h1>Lie #2 – You’re missing some key bits of information</h1><p>I’ve helped 6000+ people start writing online.</p><p>At the start I thought they were all missing some key strategy or insight that I could provide them. I’ve since learned people are drowning information.</p><p>Low performers keep acquiring more information and never implementing it because they fear failure. I came across an example yesterday.</p><p>Guy tells me he wants to build an online empire. He mentions he’s about to start his third degree (Master's) at age 40. He says the latest degree has drained his bank account and his family is struggling financially.</p><p>I politely told him if he wanted to join my inner circle he might not fit in because most of my community don’t believe in college degrees anymore. In his case he’s onto his third degree and still getting zero results while dealing with the pain of poverty.</p><p>He blew up at me when I told him this.</p><blockquote><p>“Never meet your heroes. You piece of sh*t, Denning.”</p></blockquote><p>An even bigger sign of a low performer is when they’re easily offended at a harmless remark like “you may not like our community.”</p><p>This example illustrates perfectly why more information isn’t the answer. Credentialism has led to people overloading their brains with more information, so they turn into adult babies who lack emotional intelligence and the ability to deal with failure or rejection.</p><pre><code>Obsession driven by daily habits backed by systems will get you 10x further than more information from a professor.</code></pre><p>It’s lonely being a high performer because most of the world thinks they lack information. Asking for permission and following the proven path is the default, which only leads to us becoming overwhelmed and drowning in busyness.</p><p>If you can stop being an information wh0re and digitally hoarding mountains of information, you will change the world.</p><h1>Lie #3 – People are fearless</h1><p>When you compare yourself to people on social media, it’s easy to think everyone’s winning and you’re not. This is untrue.</p><p>People aren’t fearless.</p><p>In the surveys I’ve run for the last 5 years around writing and online business the pattern has always been the same.</p><p>We’re afraid of:</p><ul><li><p>Failing</p></li><li><p>Imposter syndrome</p></li><li><p>Not feeling like an expert</p></li><li><p>Not being experienced enough</p></li><li><p>Being trolled or getting hateful comments</p></li></ul><p>The average person never gets over these fears. They prevent them from ever taking action and they never learn that it’s their fear holding them back. When you have the privilege of interacting with people from all walks of life you learn the truth.</p><pre><code>Most people are destroyed by their fears.</code></pre><p>There are very few fearless people in the world. I consider myself fearless. It makes me lonely at times. I can only name 2-3 other people who I consider to be fearless.</p><p>It makes me feel like an outlier.</p><p>As a result, I can’t comprehend how people can possibly stay in dead-end jobs when each day they’re slowly dying and their bodies are breaking down with age.</p><p>So I have to have fewer friends.</p><div><hr></div><p>Last weekend I went to a lunch with my wife’s friends. </p><p>I sat in the corner playing with my 1 year old because I couldn’t relate to the other people. They sat there and complained about their careers.</p><p>One of them even shared how his employer missed paying his salary the week prior. The whole company didn’t get paid. Their employer is struggling to pay their bills. Salaries finally got paid 4 days later because the company won a trademark infringement court case.</p><p><em>All I could hear were alarm bells.</em></p><p>The guy heard nothing. He went back to work. “She’ll be right.” I give his employer 4 weeks before they go into liquidation. He doesn’t want to change because he’s comfortable, so he just bullsh*ts himself to keep going to the office.</p><p>If you can learn to overcome fear you can easily join the top 1%.</p><h1>Lie #4 – The market is saturated</h1><p>I lied. This one is true.</p><p>But the market is saturated with low quality, piss poor crap. Excellence used to be the way. Humans used to make beautiful stuff. Now we churn out billions of widgets that all look the same and can serve a function, sure, but inspire no one.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg" width="1456" height="1905" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1905,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:627892,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a6b2a4-372c-4527-b78d-c15f66b14fe9_1549x2027.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Image Credit-Culture Critic via X</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s most obvious with architecture.

There’s no in between.</p><blockquote><p>Most people have too many goals. Too many bright ideas.</p></blockquote><p>It’s better to have one goal and forget all the other shiny objects. But this way of thinking is uncommon. When I tell people I’m 10 years into my writing goal and have 30+ years to go, they think I’m crazy. The mission is overly simplistic. There’s no chopping and changing. It’s driven by pure obsession.</p><p>A reader emailed me yesterday. “Tim, I think you’ve lost touch with what people are going through.

The market is saturated with low-quality offerings, creating an opportunity for inspiring work. Delaying goals until the future is a common mistake. Choosing the lonely path of high performance can lead to a new renaissance.	2024-10-10 19:18:46	2024-10-11 14:01:41.689	2024-10-11 14:01:43.033	{english}	https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb03c8cad-ea12-4bd1-bf08-08dad0ebb560_1042x667.jpeg	Tim Denning	being-a-high-performer-is-lonely-as-hell
